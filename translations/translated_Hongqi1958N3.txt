Romanticism and Realism

Guo Mo

five

In the development of Gibbonism, the antithesis of the paraproletariat, the proletariat, arose at the very beginning.
The proletariat's view of the world and of human beings, the progressively developing Marxism-Leninism, is responsible for transforming the world.
The worldview of the proletariat, the progressive development of Marxism-Leninism, which is responsible for the transformation of the world, has already brought a new light to the history of mankind. .

Since the success of the October Socialist Revolution forty years ago, more than one-third of humanity has been guided by Marxism-Leninism.
Under the guidance of Leninism, more than one-third of the population of the whole of mankind has mastered its own destiny, and every day it is creating unprecedented miracles.
Every day, they are creating unprecedented wonders. In terms of women's artistic activity, Chopsticks Leninism provides an ideal for Bourgeoisism and an ideal for Realism.
This became the revolutionary romanticism and the life-saving realism that we need today, or the appropriate synthesis of the two.
a proper synthesis of the two, a socialist realism.

In the last hundred years, although China has been constantly influenced by Western thinking, it has gradually become more and more socialist and realistic.
thought, but due to its gradual colonialization, the Chinese proletariat has been able to develop its own socialist ideology.
The Chinese proletariat has not yet been able to bring about a democratic revolution in a competent manner.
The Chinese proletariat has not been able to organize a democratic revolution in a competent manner. - As a result, the "May Day" of the 90,000th anniversary
The "May Fourth" movement took place in the 1990s, and the Chinese women's art movement and the Western women's art movement were in harmony with each other.
movement came into direct contact with the western Wave
The names of Liuism and Realism were popularized.
Some people were also interested in the "May Fourth" movement. After the May Fourth Movement, some

Some people also put such labels on the literary factions that emerged after the May Fourth Movement. For example, the Creation Society was labeled as
"Touwenism" and the Literary Research Society as "Realism". and the Literature Research Association, "Realism".
Hamamitsu, in fact, were just similar. But it's a good distinction.
That's a good distinction. It shows that in modern China
That's to show that in modern China, Romanticism and Realism have been in existence for a long time.
In modern China, Romanticism and Realism go hand in hand, Romanticism is anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism.
In less than a decade, both were working in tandem.

-In less than a decade, both ran through a hundred years of modern European history.
"Romanticism" and "Realism"? The Romantics and the Realists?
The "Romanticists" and "Realists" had already merged under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, forming a revolutionary female army.
A revolutionary feminized army. This feminized army, as Mao Zedong said in his
As Mao Zedong said, "It helped the Chinese revolution, made China's feudal culture and adaptability to imperialist aggression more effective.
It helped the Chinese revolution and made China's feudal culture and the bought-and-paid-for gynecization, which was adapted to the imperialist aggression, more and more difficult.
This army, as Mao Zedong said, "has helped the Chinese revolution, making the land and zones of China's feudal culture and the bought-and-paid-for feminization of China, which were adapted to the imperialist aggression, shrink by and by, and its power gradually come forward." ("Mao
This is the inevitable formation of the Chinese Revolution.
This is the inevitable formation of China. Chinese romanticism has not lost its
Chinese romanticism has not lost its destiny, but has long been subjected to the rationale of the Ming Dynasty, and Chinese realism has not been tainted by the Western tongue.
Chinese realism has not been tainted by Western influences, but has long
China's realism has not been tainted with the influence of the Western tongue, but has long been equipped with the soul of revolution. In particular, in 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong
In particular, in 1941, after the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Gubing at the Yan'an Literary Symposium
After the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Ice" at the Yan'an Literary Symposium in 1941, it is certain that the Chinese proletariat's literary
It is certain that the Chinese proletariat had a clearer direction for its literature and art.
1.

| The Chinese proletariat was in the process of developing a new direction for literature and art in China.
The romanticism and realism in art and culture were very strong in spirit and substance.
Romanticism and Realism are sometimes difficult to distinguish in terms of spiritual substance.
It is a general tendency that the former emphasizes the emotions and the latter the intellect.
But emotion and knowledge are the spiritual activities of human beings.
cannot risk having only emotion but no intellect, or only intellect but no emotion.
We can be so surnamed. When a person is young, he or she has more
The components of warmism are more, and the components of realism are less.
In the prime of life, the situation may be quite the opposite.
Therefore, it is impossible to analyze a writer or a work by chemical characterization.
It is impossible to analyze a writer or a work by the qualitative and quantitative methods of chemistry, to formulate his or its own theory.
It is therefore impossible to analyze a writer or a work by means of chemical qualitative and quantitative analysis, and to formulate his or its fundamentalist component as a percentage of the table.
The fundamentalist component of a writer or a work is one percent and the rationalist component is two percent.

A few percent. Xuan-u is the reflection and criticism of real life, if the

The spirit of romanticism. It has been said that Marx's "Das Kapital"
It has been said that Marx's "Das Kapital" is a big script, which reveals the discrepancy between cynicism and scientific activity, between populism and realism.
It shows the difference between cynicism and scientific activity, between romanticism and realism.

The indivisible sameness, or the unity of the two.

It is difficult to determine the great writers of the past and present.
It's hard to decide whether they were evidentialist or realist.

"It is very difficult to determine whether he is a positivist or a realist. Let me give you some examples to illustrate.

For example, the great ancient Herman Juanzhu of our country, that

"Small is like a wave of the strongest. His "away from

He uses a lot of material, he's got a great deal of skill, he's got a great deal of skill, he's got a great deal of skill, he's got a great deal of skill.

He started from reality and returned to the present, putting his own life and death completely at risk.
He was completely indifferent to his own life and death. The things he cared about were all-encompassing.

The most obvious example is our biographer Mao Zedong.

The most notable example is our biographer Mao Zedong. He developed Marxism-Leninism in China's revolutionary practice.
He developed Marxism-Leninism in China's revolutionary practice, and he was one of the greatest realists.
He was the greatest realist of all time, but I have to say that Mao Zedong was also the greatest of all time.
He was also the greatest romantic. He was

a great revolutionary, a great writer, and a great romantic.

He was a great revolutionary, a great writer, and a great human being. His writings have a great appeal.
Like the writings of Marx and Lenin, they contain a

only write cynical essays; in recent years he has officially issued
In recent years, he has formally issued nineteen hezhangs, which have added to China's literary treasure trove.

Not only did he continue to publish numerous unscriptural and schematic treatises, but he also developed the Bureau of Electricity in the course of revolutionary practice.
He not only continued to publish many different theses, and in the course of his revolution, he developed Ketan-Leninism to educate the 600 million people.
He has also published a number of model works in the course of his work.

- In addition, he has published literary and artistic works of the same type as his multivolume works.

It has the same significance as the multi-volume works. I am particularly pleased with the publication of Mao Zedong's works of romanticism.

The object of worship is not the person who is the representative of the person who is standing. If it is a person who represents the principle, such as Mr. Tikrit, Mr. Leshoure, and Mr. Mao Tse-tung, why don't we worship them as teachers?
Why don't we worship our teachers, such as Karl Marx, Leshoure, and Mao Zedong?
Of course, I'm sure that all these outstanding teachers are still the same.

Not only is his poetry good, but also his person is good, or filial piety.

Of course, I studied him as a person.

First of all, they have to "change from one class to another" and start from the middle class to the lower class.
The first step is to "change from one class to another class", to change from the intellectuals of the proletariat and the petty proletariat to the communist intellectuals of the proletariat.
intellectuals to proletarian and communist intellectuals. Mr. Mao Wendong, in general, wanted to "change from a class to a different class".
Mao Wen-dong always said, "The base of the Hungarian people is to be the hiring of the Chinese people, and they have to change from a class to another". The first step was to "realize the importance of the communist ideology".

A new society, a new person
Chan Pak Kwan

While completing the socialist revolutions of Ch'ien-hsin, the government and the war, we will gradually realize the technological and cultural revolutions, and give priority to heavy industry, industry and agriculture.
In the meantime, we will gradually realize the technological and cultural revolutions, and give priority to the development of heavy industry, industry and agriculture, and centralize the development of the public sector. Public
Under the conditions of centralized planning and division of labor, central and local industries will be developed together, and heavenly enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises will be developed.
 These are the second day of the Party's First Congress of the People's Republic of China based on Comrade Mao Fusi's visit to formulate the drumming up of energy, striving for advancement, and making more progress.
Drumming up energy, striving for upstream, fast and good street construction of the general line of villagerism contains several key points. The shape of the actual more jade more clear
The clearer the shape, the clearer the understanding. On the road to accelerating the development of China's chuenism, it is important to fully stimulate the spirit of creativity, the spirit of the masses and the spirit of the people.
These points carry a very great revolutionary significance.

Since the autumn and winter of last year, in the campaign to build up water conservancy and fertilizers in the countryside, the power of local and mass initiative has already been demonstrated.
The power of local and mass initiative has already appeared. The power of this high degree of initiative has been demonstrated again in the local campaign to build small and medium-sized industries.
The power of this spirit of initiative has been demonstrated again in the campaigns for building small and medium-sized local industries.

According to the materials of the State Bureau of Statistics, this year, various small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises have been started and built by local units and agricultural cooperatives, totaling more than several hundred thousand.
The total number of industrial and mining enterprises is more than hundreds of thousands. What is particularly worthwhile here is that (1) the small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises that can be built before next year's big month will have a total of 1,200,000 units.
The number of small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises that can be built by next year is particularly worthwhile.
There are more than one hundred small-scale steel-making plants to be completed by the end of next year, with a capacity of 10,000,000 tons, equivalent to the existing steel-making capacity of Trench Post.
(3) More than 2,400 small and medium-sized non-ferrous gold mining enterprises will be built, which, when completed, will be able to add 10 million tons of steel-making capacity, equivalent to the existing steel-making capacity of Trench Post.
The output of gold and gold mining enterprises will exceed that of the Principality in 1957. ...... so and so short.

So it seems, as long as in more than a year's time flash, the development of small and medium-sized industries of the local release planning tiger mode, there are a number of ministries and stations
Will go on even better than the first five-year plan like the rest of the country rules and regulations. Some of the industrial sectors originally intended to wait until the 19th day of the second year, that is, the first five-year plan.
The production volume which could only be reached in 19 or 20 years, when the first five-year plan was completed, may be reached in this year due to the large number of local small and medium-sized industries.
It is possible to achieve this in this year.

In agriculture, we have also been able to see that if there are no major natural disasters, the harvests of some of the crops we need this year will reach or reach the target.
This year, if there are no major natural disasters, the harvests of some of the most important crops will reach or approach the yields of the last year of the first five-year plan, which was previously proposed.

All these are the conditions under which the spirit of local initiative and the spirit of mass initiative have been fully developed and controlled, and our society has been able to realize a great leap forward in productivity.
The gluten of the great leap forward in productivity.

Of course, possibility is not the same as reality. It is only necessary to remember that the workers and peasants, under the guidance of the Party, are making a great leap forward in the form of a new generation of workers and peasants.

The 8th of .9.

| | | | | | |
If we remember that the masses of workers and peasants, under the guidance of our Party, are working with the heroic spirit of "Chang Gong Yi Shang" millions of times more to create more and more novelties of labor, and if we think of the endless potentials hidden in various places, then we can agree that the possibilities mentioned above will surely become reality.
If we think about the endless potential of each place, then we will be able to realize that the possibilities that we have mentioned above will definitely become reality.

The "Road to Recovery" and the several key points it contains have thoroughly solved the problem of the high speed of development of China's people and the development of the country's people at a high speed.
It has also revolutionized society as a whole.

In this issue, we publish the articles of "Xuguang~- and the society to run a small factory with two methods" and "Xuguang's past and its future" of the Hubei Echeng County Committee. and "Xuguang's past
and "How Xuguang has been organizing and managing small factories? The two newsletters described Both newsletters described new developments in a cooperative.
The first newsletter is about a new project in a cooperative. The first newsletter describes how the cooperative organized a series of "small factories*" and thus contributed to the development of the farming community. which in turn contributed to the development of agriculture.
The second one describes how the cooperative brought agricultural and industrial management together, and how this was the first step in the development of the cooperative.

This is a quick and effective way to show the role of local and popular initiative in the industrialization of the Principality of Ghana.
The role of the masses in the industrialization of the Principality of Xiban. Through these two articles, we can see that in the Great Leap Forward, China is in the midst of a new house and new people.
The masses here are almost a group of heroic and heroic men with the greatest vigor and ambition. They dare to think.
To do, and do, and good at listening to everyone's views, down-to-earth, people reasonable, organized. A road.
There are ideals, and there are ways. With Comrade Mao Zedong's warping as, they are in the original that blank spot, ""write the latest and most
"write the newest and the most beautiful writing", "draw the newest and the most beautiful pictures".       --
The practices of this collaboration and knee-jerk approach are generally as follows.
1. The transformation of a cooperative into a grass-roots unit of both agricultural and industrial cooperation is in fact a merger of agriculture and industry.
(1) To turn a cooperative into a grass-roots unit with both agricultural and industrial co-operation, and in effect a people's commune combining agriculture and industry.
(2) The purpose of setting up industries is to meet the needs of the cooperative as a whole and to serve agricultural production rather than to make money.
The purpose of industry is to meet the needs of the cooperative as a whole and to serve agricultural production, not to make money.
3# ) To keep things simple, starting with small factories and expanding them later.
(4#) The cooperative developed a movement for "jack-of-all-trades," which was both labor and safety. The members were taught agricultural techniques as well as industrial skills.
They had to learn both agricultural and industrial techniques. "They were peasants in the fields and workers in the factories.
They learnt at the same time and "made friends" everywhere. The first step is to get some general knowledge of science and technology, and then to seek to learn more about it.
Business. The technological revolution and the feminization revolution are in harmony.
(6) Managers learn to manage, but they also have to learn technology, and they are workers as well.
With the exception of a few special cases, work in industry and macro-industry was credited. As a rule, factory work must not be higher than agricultural work, nor must it be higher than agricultural work.
Generally speaking, factory work should not be higher or lower than that of agriculture, but it should be kept flexible, and should vary according to the specific conditions of the work.
But a certain degree of flexibility is maintained, depending on the circumstances of the work.
(8) The hours of work in industry and agriculture are the same, and if they are increased, a system of credits is adopted in order to penalize the work of the workers.
0 Labor 958

| The work of the workers is not subject to the same conditions as that of the workers.
Reward.        II
(9) In accordance with the principle of integration of industry and agriculture, small factories have a plan for year-round struggle and a plan for implementation in separate pots.
There are also plans for implementation in separate pots.
What this cooperation has done is to show that our country is able to develop its productive forces at an unprecedentedly high rate, to develop its economy at an unprecedentedly high rate, and to develop its economy at an unprecedentedly high rate.
This means that our country can develop the productive forces of society at an unprecedentedly high rate, eliminate the distinction between industry and agriculture and between mental and physical labor more rapidly than ever before, and thus
The right way to create smooth conditions for the transition from socialism to communism.
I think it's entirely possible.

More than a hundred years ago, Gus, in his book "Principles of Communism", wrote that he would like to see a new way of doing things in order to realize the full realization of communism. In his work "Principles of Communism", Gus argued that after the total abolition of private ownership.
"The excess of production over the recent needs of the Temple, instead of causing a catastrophe, will ensure the satisfaction of the needs of all the citizens, will give rise to new needs, and will at the same time give rise to new needs.
New needs will be aroused, and at the same time means will be created by which such new needs can be satisfied." "Using the entire power of the Zhukai to jointly color the
"The new development of production and the consequent development of production by the power of the whole society will also require a completely new kind of man, and the help will be created to create this new man.
"An industry planned by the whole community and operated for the common good requires even more capable people in every respect, i.e. people who can understand the whole system of production, who can understand the whole system of production.
That is to say, men who can understand the whole system of production." "Mathematical education enables young people to familiarize themselves quickly with the whole system of production, and it enables them to adapt themselves to the needs of society or to their own needs.
It enables them to move from one sector of production to another in turn, according to the needs of society or their own preferences.
"...... The conflict between the city and the country will disappear. Those engaged in agricultural and industrial labor will be the same people, no longer two different classes.
longer two distinct classes, and this has become for material reasons a necessary condition of the communist union." Ing.
What Shan was saying at the time was an ideal based on the laws of social development. It may or may not be changed, in the context of our Party's general policy of building unionism faster and better.
Under the Party's general line of "building communism faster, better and more efficiently," Naokwang Ilsha is realizing this ideal of the Founder of Scientific Communism in real life, concretely and step by step.
Is it possible to realize the ideals of the founder of scientific communism in real life? I am sure it is possible to do so.

The titles of the two newsletters were both labeled "A Little Factory". The title of both newsletters was very progressive, "The Little Factory". But these "little factories" are linked to agriculture.
However, this kind of "small factories", which are linked to agriculture, have unlimited vitality because they represent an irresistible, new, advancing force, the power of the Communist Party, and the power of the Communist Party of China.
They represent the irresistible, new, advancing force of communism.

From the time when Guangyi ran a small factory with local methods
E-cheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China

In the days of the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production, Zhangbei Province Rh of

E-cheng County, Du out of the light Tan light the first agricultural production cooperation and the society was organized quickly. The production of . The results are great. Just one more

A variety of hair tools, tools four hundred and eleven. Joint processing
The joint processing factory also began to be hemp noodles. The difficulty of lack of fertilizer was solved.
The bottom fertilizer of the cotton field was all used in the granular fertilizer of self-wood.
Now they are making fertilizers for rice and cotton.
These small factories promote the development of agricultural production and also increase the cooperation between the cooperative organizations.
These small factories promote the development of agricultural production and also increase the income and reduce the expenses of the cooperative.
"The original plan was to buy new plows, which cost 10 yuan each, but the small factories made their own machines.
The factory's homemade machine only has a few yuan; the cotton sowing machine is ready to be purchased.
The plan was to buy a new type of plow, which cost thirty-four yuan each, but now the small factory is making its own machine, which costs thirty-four yuan.
The use of three village ice uranium modified rolling simple strip sowing curse, only one yuan each.
The price of coloring material is five yuan per hundred pounds, and the water factory produces it for only one yuan.
The water factory produces only one dollar and twenty cents. In just one
In just one month's time, the society saved more than one thousand dollars.
Run these small factories also promote the orthopedic technology.
The small factories have also promoted orthopedic technological development. In the past year or so, the double-stay has only changed

In the past year or so, only thirteen types of work and methods of operation have been clarified and improved.

After the establishment of the small factory, they have not invented and created twelve tools within a month.
Twelve tools were invented within a month after the establishment of the small factory. In the past, even the small factory thought of utilizing power tools.
Now it took a few men only one night's work to make the tool.
"In one night, a few men made a general machine for eleven dollars. The same is true for the
As the director of the agricultural tools factory, Comrade Ren Baozi, said, "We only know what we can't do, but we don't know what we can't do.
I'm not sure I can do it. *The small factory pointed out the bright future of the industrialization of the village.
The bright future of industrialization of the village. Some of them only cursed.
"In the past, we always talked about industrialization, but in fact, we don't see it now.
Now. The wine is coming closer and closer.
This bamboo organized these small factories, the province has hit the country
We need a woman, a man, a machine, but we rely on the masses.
It was run by the masses, using the Huai method and the Shang Shang method.
The bamboo adhered to three principles in running the factories. Firstly
Firstly, according to the strength and source of responsibility, we started to run only small-scale factories, and then gradually expanded them.
First, in accordance with the needs and resources available, we started with small-scale factories and gradually expanded them later on.
The first was based on the principle of "2.

Firstly, in the spirit of 2. serving the agricultural production, we should not do it only for the sake of earning money; thirdly, the factories should be organized in different levels.
Thirdly, the factories that should be operated should be prioritized.
Thirdly, the factories that should be operated should be prioritized and the factories that should be operated on the current agricultural production should be operated.

Solve the problem of capital by relying on the cooperation of the masses

The first problem they encountered in running the factories was where to get the funds from?
Where did the money come from?

To run these small factories, they needed more than $35,200, one hundred and fifty-two dollars.
The money that Jean-Louis had collected from the production of the factory for seven years and the public savings were more than $40,000, but this could only be used as a source of money for the poor.
Although there were more than 40,000 yuan, this could not be used as a source of funds for the production costs of the small factories.
In 1958, the production costs of the family theater industry were reduced. The management committee
The Board of Management met to study the matter and decided to draw 22,000 yuan from the agricultural production fund.
The committee decided to withdraw $22 from the agricultural production expenses for the factory and return it to the factory after the harvesting of oil tea seeds.
The oil tea seeds will be returned later. However, this amount of money was still not used.
However, this amount alone was not enough for the factory. Comrade Hu Qi-stubborn, the director of Xu, remembered the words of Comrade Peng Ying of the county party committee.
Comrade Peng Ying's words: "All difficulties can be solved by the masses.
So, the committee decided to hold a meeting with the people to solve the problem.
The committee decided to solve the problem by means of a public inquiry and set a "reasonable price".
A "reasonable price, buy at the price, pay back in installments, and pay interest every month".
and pay back in installments with monthly interest. The government also set up a "reasonable price, buy at the price, pay back in installments, and pay interest every month" charter.

The members of the society were very enthusiastic about the idea of setting up factories and industrialization.
They were very enthusiastic about this, and after learning about the program, they were very excited.
They sang: "Sex is in the air," they said. They sang: "Sex symbols are sprouting every year.
We're young, we're young, we're young, we're young.
We are going to set up three factories in January, and we are going to be a walk in the park," they sang.
I'm going to use it to do my own work. The fluffy fertilizer is just right, not fluffy, not loose.
Not to be dispersed. The cost of power generation is low, and joint processing is much more

The Committee recognized that this kind of thinking was a noteworthy trend, and held a meeting of the whole committee.
The committee held a general meeting with all the members, and the director of the society, Mr. Hu Changlian, told everyone at the meeting that they would like to start the production.
The director of the society, Hu Changlian, told everyone at the meeting: "We are going to start our factory, and we only have so many gills.
We are going to start our factory, and we only have so many gills, so we have to close the house, and we don't want to buy machines.
If we don't buy machines, what should we do?" All of them were very happy.
Some of them said, "We have to build a house to make it decent.
Some said, "How can we close it? The children are going to the ground, so we have to name it first.
I'm happy to name them, but the factory is not yet in operation, so I'm just going to propose a name for them. How much will it cost in the future?
How much will it cost in the future? A few old farmers were discussing the matter.

In order to guide the production, the management committee of the Wojo-Ishikawa Prefectural Government made the following decisions.
In order to guide the production, the committee divided the work of the whole village into four categories: agriculture, agriculture, industry and finance,
Agriculture, Side Industry, Industry, and Finance, with a deputy director for each of these fronts.
Each of these fronts was headed by a deputy director.

When they started to run factories, some of the cadres started to follow the example of the big factories.
Some people said, "A factory is a factory with a set of rules and organizations. Some people said, "A factory is all about the factory manager.
The factory director, the factory also has to have an accountant, the Fanxiao ......".

In addition to the lack of subsidies, there were also freezes in the production process, which deeply affected the quality of life of the peasants.
The masses of the community were educated in this way. The masses wanted their own factories and
They also love their cadres.

Workers and peasants, work points are wages.

How do you determine a worker's wage? If it's high, members will have a problem with it.
If it is too high, the employees will have a problem with it, but if it is too low, they will not be allowed to enter the factory. Since the
Since the launching of the "All Man" campaign, a new situation has arisen in the community.
The new situation is that "to work is to be a farmer" and "to work in the fields is to be a farmer".
They are farmers in the fields, but not in the factories.
In the factories, the workers are just peasants, and the peasants are just peasants. There was no distinction between workers and peasants.
As a result, everyone thought that "factory production was also agricultural production, and workers' labor was agricultural labor.
Workers' wages are agricultural wages". In this way, in addition to helping
In this way, except for the tractor drivers who worked for and against the factory, the rest of the workers were workers.

The workers' wages were also agricultural wages. 15.

People participate in the same way as agricultural labor in the distribution of labor points.
The distribution of labor was the same as that of agricultural labor. The method of keeping labor points varies according to the situation of the county.
The method of keeping labor credits varies according to the county. The pumping machine type of work is determined by the state, and a year-round contracted labor method is adopted.
The contracted work and the work score of the community: seven nickel-water pumpers and one water pumping machine.
The workers in the common work and then according to the pumping time fixed points.

When a kilogram of fertilizer is made, the factory pays ten percent of the total amount of fertilizer.

In addition, the amount of leaves is divided according to the level of skill, and the high level of skill is divided according to the level of skill.
and the highest quintal of agricultural work as the standard, each labor
The standard was eleven cents for each day of labor, and the rest of the work was done in a similar manner. Later, some of the bamboo workers rebelled against it.
Some of the bamboo workers opposed the idea that some of them did not work in the morning, but still required twelve cents for the rest of the day, which was not reasonable.
It was not reasonable. So, they changed the system to keep the labor according to the hour of the hulou. That is
Technically, it was calculated according to the time of work, and the time of work was calculated according to the time of work. For example
The three-pole fixed box is ten points, the time is one point in the middle, four minutes at noon, four minutes in the afternoon.
If you don't turn it over in the morning, you will lose one point in training.
The time is one point in the morning. Some martial arts products can't be paid on a piecework basis, so they can only be credited on time, and then later on.

The factory production program was subordinated to agricultural production

Even a small factory must have a special program.
The goal is to achieve the goal. The factory production plan is based on the development needs of the agricultural production.
The development of agricultural production needs to make and prove a long-term production plan.
With a long-term plan, it must also be implemented in stages. The implementation of the program is divided into sections.
In the implementation of the program, also with the action of agricultural production, each work six to propose the appropriate base tasks.
The tasks of each work group should be made according to the base. For example, in the current summer harvest
For example, in the current summer harvest, "Lostma fast", all let to finish within ten days of the raid, the

Men, women, and children are all on the block, and a good summer harvest is in store for them.
The slogan of this campaign was: "The farm equipment is the best way to make a good harvest in summer". In response to this request, the Agricultural Tools Factory repaired and manufactured 140 tools in the first three days.
Three days ago, the Agricultural Tools Factory repaired and manufactured more than one hundred and forty knives, and one hundred and twenty pieces of armor.

Breaking the Mystery of Industry
   The first-rate

China's industrial development by leaps and bounds has taken many people by surprise. The first five months of this year
Europe's total industrial output, compared with the same period last year, an increase of thirty percent, of which the realm of April
In April, it grew by 41 percent, and in May, it grew by 4.6 percent, and it is estimated that the growth rate will be even higher in the future.
The rate of growth is expected to be even higher in the future. This year, China's iron and steel production is expected to exceed 10 million tons, and next year it is estimated to exceed 20 million tons.
Next year, it is estimated that it may exceed 20 million tons. Thus, it seems that our production of steel and other major industrial products is catching up with that of other countries.
The production of steel and other major industrial products in our country has no face to catch up with that of Britain, and it is still much shorter than what we had thought before.
This information is really amazing. This information, indeed, is amazing, not only those who live far away from the stolen
not only those who live far away, but also those who live in our great country, but also those who live in our great country.
The message is not only lost on those who live far away, but also on the part of those who live in our great country.           (SIGHS)

There is no doubt that the Party's wholehearted leadership, especially the Party's courageous efforts, has been responsible for this leap in our industry.
There is no doubt that the Party's wholehearted guidance, especially the Party's guidance of drumming up energy, striving to go upstream, and building a reformist society more quickly and economically, is the key to the development of China's industry.
The Party's overall guidance, in particular, the Party's enthusiasm for building socialism, was the decisive factor,
creativity, which is the decisive factor; at the same time the great revolution in the method of industrial construction also
This is a decisive factor. This was a decisive factor; at the same time, the revolution in the methods of industrial construction was also of great significance.

The revolution in the method of industrial construction is to completely break down the secretive viewpoints on the running of industry and to implement the "socialist" concept of "socialism".
The great revolution in the method of industrial construction is to completely dispel the kind of secretive views on the running of industry, and to realize the running of industry by the whole party, by each country, and by the rest of the people.

The mystical view of running industry can be absolutely inserted as *big>, "high>, <"country? These
three words like this.

"Big", that is, the mention of running industry, the heart of the month, only large industries, and rarely have
medium-sized industries, not to mention small industries. To build iron and steel plants, it is Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, and Baotou Iron and Steel Company.
Company, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Baotou Iron and Steel Company; to build a chemical plant, it is Jilin
Fertilizer plant, too anorexia fertilizer plant; beans to build oil plant, is Lanzhou torch oil plant, and ear
Can only be natural oil; to build fierce tractor factory, is the Luoyang Tractor Wish Factory and so on.
Of course, the big industry was and will remain the medium of our accessionist industrialization.
In, we must develop all kinds of big industries that our country needs. However, if we only

Limited stamina, material resources "frozen essence? In a few projects, and can not make the industrial coastal blossom, learning to put color. The fruit of the stove.
It is also inevitable to limit the high speed development of industry.

The implementation of large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises at the same time to promote the policy, the head of the field appeared another kind of moving party image. According to the Henan, Hebei, Liaozhu
South, Hebei, Liaozhu and other ten provinces, cities and districts, in the first five months of this year, the construction of industrial production units was completed and put into large-scale production.
In the first five months of this year, there were 510,000 industrial production units put into production, and more than 32 industrial production units were put into production every day in Janggou.
production. Among these 510,000 industrial production units, there are 20,000 magpies above the county level, and the rest are organized by townships, plating and
The others were set up by village, plating and handicraft cooperatives. As these new industrial production units were put into production in a casual manner, the production capacity of the Haumea industrial sector doubled.
The production capacity of the industrial sector has grown exponentially.

"Some people think that this kind of industrial production unit is so small that it cannot play any significant role in the cause of our country's fanatic industrialization.
This kind of viewpoint is not generous. They don't understand that small can become big, and they don't understand the relationship between quality and quantity. For example.
In the metallurgical industry, this year the Principality will build more than thirteen thousand small and medium-sized iron scintillators, which will have a total production capacity of more than two thousand tons per year.
The total annual production capacity is more than 20 million tons, which is equal to four to five times of the current production capacity of the donkey ironworks.
This year the Duchy will build more than one hundred small and medium-sized ironworks, with a total annual capacity of more than ten million tons, equal to two to three times the present capacity of the steel mills in the mountains.
The total annual production capacity is more than ten million tons, which is equal to two to three times of the current production capacity of the steel mills in the mountainous areas. Because of the highwa and turn baking through the blossoming of the ground, iron and pot water everywhere to see the flow, China's net
Zhan industry's backwardness and appearance, very choice to be changed. In this way, as en rong yin remember now, "a single large amount of change, up to a fixed
If we only build a large-scale iron ore joint venture like the child crane, we will not be able to realize our goal in such a short time.
If we had only built large iron ore complexes like the one in Hsidong, we would not have been able to achieve such great results in such a short period of time and at such a low cost. This is true not only for the gold industry.
This is true not only for the gold industry, but also for the coal industry, the wine industry, the chemical fertilizer industry, and other industries. We can see that as long as we can drink
break through the concept of "big industry" and implement large-scale enterprises. and implement large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises at the same time, our country's industry can be

leap forward.

"High" means that when it comes to running an industry, we should run a high standard one. The first thing we need to do is to set up a high standard of industry, that is to say, it is necessary to set up modernized, mechanized and self-modernized enterprises, and to import the whole set from foreign countries.
The enterprise, from the eating plan Han Rongbei Jing to be a full set of foreign imports, rather than from the specific situation of our country, realistic
Instead of starting from the specific situation of our country, we should realistically make the high standard and low standard at the same time, "Shi method" and *foreign method? At the same time.

There is no doubt that, in order to realize the modernization of our country's industrial ice as soon as possible, we need to focus on the rapid adoption of new technologies in some industrial sectors.
In order to modernize our industry as soon as possible, we need to focus on the rapid adoption of new technology and equipment, and we also need those foreign methods that are necessary for us But everything has to be "up-to-date and up-to-date".
But everything has to be "up-to-date" and everything has to be "foreign". But everything has to be "up-to-date" and everything is "foreign", which is wrong. Especially the local, mass-run ones,
Small ones. "Two? The industrial enterprises which are run by the local people and run by the masses are regarded as not conforming to the "science" and are discriminated against, which is even more wrong. It is even more wrong to discriminate against all of them.
That is even more wrong.

Under the condition that there are not many new equipments, they use their own laborious hands and sensitive mind, and in the first five months of this year, they have succeeded in testing thousands of new products, and adopted a variety of new methods and techniques.

The progress is very slow. Instead, the central industry and local industry were simultaneously organized, and the party-run industry, the various sulfur, and the local industry were all organized at the same time.

By adopting the policy of the Party organizing industry, the Party organizing industry, and the people organizing industry, the industry of our country appeared to be in such a situation as that of the ten thousand rolls running crispy now. As mentioned before
Ling, this year only in a short period of months, Dengtu all over the base did not use the state how much will, how much material, mainly dumping
Also local self-financing, the masses of cooperation set spring method, on the construction of the success of five - two corridor of industrial production first, each thousand, city, month
In each city and district, there are tens of thousands of enterprises, and most of the townships and villages have their own industries. In four
Soon before us there appeared such a scene as "Machines are ringing everywhere, labor horses are parked in towns and villages". We were soon faced with a situation in which "machines were going off everywhere, and workers were moving to the towns and villages". It was a great success.
. It is clear that, while developing centralized industry, we should help the government, the city, and the people of Yanfu to develop their own strengths, and the people of Yanfu to develop their own strengths, and the people of Yanfu to develop their own strengths, and the people of Yanfu to develop their own strengths.
By utilizing our own strength and the power of the masses to run our industries, we can make our industries develop at the fastest pace.

At the same time, the industry organized by the central government should also pay attention to give full play to the positive aspects of enterprises. This is important for the development of industry in a faster, better and more economical way.
"This is of great significance to the development of industry in a quicker, better and more economical way. For example, the expansion project of the Shijingshi net excellent factory, in the past, by the central government to dissolve the Ministry of gold a package.
The project was contracted by the central government's ministry of finance." "The suffering of the young people in the disaster relief and literary symposium", "Mao Zedong's Thoughts and Strategies - 3rd Fung, East 88th Huang.

At the end of 1958, the company invested 200 million yuan in the area, and its production capacity could only reach 1.4 million tons of iron and 500,000 tons of net per year.
Now, the production capacity can be increased by more than 1 million tons per year if the plant is constructed by the factory and the original investment is used.
The production capacity can be increased by more than one million tons. This is simply unthinkable from the old point of view.

How did the secretive view of running an industry come about?8 This is because there are some people who still have traces of the old days in their minds.
This is because some people still have traces of the old days in their minds, and they are so self-centered that they think that our country is backward, and that this is not good enough, nor is the cable good enough; and they have no idea of how to run an industry.
They are not aware of the mass point of view and the mass line. They don't think that the strength of 1,000,000 industrial workers, together with the strength of more than 100 million peasants, can be spilled over into the membership.
With the strength of 10 million industrial workers, together with the strength of more than 100 million peasants, they will be able to create a new record in the construction of unionism.

As we all know, the wealth of society is created by the four working people. No other country in the world has such a rich labor force as ours.
There is no other country in the world that has such an abundant labor force as ours. In addition to the working class of the People's Congress, the main force for the development of our industry is the great allies of the working class.
In addition to the working class of the People's Congress, there are also one hundred million peasants, who are the great allies of the working class. Our peasants are not ordinary peasants, but under the guidance of the working class.
The peasants of China are not ordinary peasants, but the peasants who, under the guidance of the working class, have carried out the democratic revolution and the two-day revolution, and are the revolutionaries who have organized themselves and embarked on the road to socialism.
It is a revolutionary people who have been organized and have embarked on the road to socialism. aamejnaspmreenaeee Our industry provides the largest domestic market in the world.
Our industry provides the largest domestic market in the world, which is known to all. However, it is well known that our peasants can also provide industry with a large amount of heavy industrial materials.
provide the bulk of the heavy industry's raw materials. The reason why our basic raw material industry has been able to develop at a high rate recently, for example, the increase of pot coke by nearly 10 million tons.
The increase of pot coke is nearly ten million hours, coal hair is tens of millions of dollars, these raw materials are Yuxi to pick up? The main
ether rely on farmers. This is a new situation and a new peak. From this we can see that if we can make our country's
If we can make our country's industry develop by leaps and bounds, in addition to relying on the strength of the working class, we must also rely on the strength of more than 500 million peasants. This is the greatest strength of the peasants in our country.
The greatest force of the peasants in China is the peasants who do not know much about the Chinese revolution or the building of China.
The only way to avoid making mistakes is to make mistakes in politics. The reason why the mystical view of running an industry is wrong and must be broken is not only that the peasants have not been able to understand China's revolution, but also that they have made mistakes in the political arena.
The reason why the mystical view of running industry is wrong and must be broken is not only because they make light of the strength of the masses of workers in China, but also because they look down on the peasants who have thrown up and risen up.
The peasants, do not rely on the joint efforts of workers and farmers to develop industry.

The Party's general line of initiation and construction of science and technology points out that under the conditions of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, industry and agriculture are to be developed at the same time, in a pseudo-planned and centralized manner.
Under the conditions of pseudo-planning, centralized guidance and division of labor, the central industry and the Kunfang industry should be developed simultaneously, and large-scale operations and small- and medium-sized enterprises should be developed in parallel.
In addition to mobilizing the strength of the working class, what is more energetic is to bring together the great strength of more than 500 million peasants.
The more important thing is to mobilize the great power of more than 500 million farmers into the country. If the industry and agriculture are mobilized, the power of more than 500 million farmers can be mobilized.
The central and local governments can mobilize the power of dozens of provinces and cities in China; the universities, colleges, universities and small towns can mobilize the power of the people of China; and the "two foreign countries" can mobilize the power of the people of China. It is possible to
The power of the people with high feminization skills and low intersection skills can be mobilized. So, this is a big movement of liberation, a movement of silk.
It is a movement of liberation, a movement to mobilize all the weaving and weaving elements to run the industry, and it is a method of building the industry. It is a great grassroots movement in the industrial construction method.
It's a big movement to build up industry.

The Party's total approach to industrialization broke the pastoral view that industry could only be run by a handful of people and shone a light on our country's industrialization.
The Party's view that industry can only be run by a handful of people has been half broken, and it has illuminated the way to industrial development in China, which has brought our industry to a new stage of rapid development.

After years of hard work, the output of China's fox-making industry in 1957 exceeded the highest annual output of the pre-Liberation period by 4.5 percent.
In 1957, the output of China's fox-making industry exceeded 4.5 times the highest annual output before liberation. The development of the foil-making industry is still very good, but it is still not enough to satisfy the needs of the Japanese sentinel.
However, it is still unable to satisfy the needs of the growing society.

During the first five-year plan, we paid attention only to wood pulp, but not to the pulp.
During the first five-year plan, we paid attention only to wood pulp and did not emphasize on kanji pulp. The newly built and expanded large-scale foil factories basically used kanji pulp as raw material. During this
During this period, there were basically no new and expanded fox mills at the local level, and some of the small mills that used chapter paddles as raw materials were also stopped.
Some of the small factories that use the seal paddle as raw material have also stopped production. When we stipulate the quality standard of ice, we also
Require the use of a considerable proportion of wood paddle as raw material. As a result of these practices, the
We could not satisfy the demand of the ice field, and the fox factory could not realize its production capacity because of the lack of wood.
The production capacity of the fox factory could not be utilized because there was not enough kimura. This led to the emergence of the "Jangrim no Yakko" (the "Janglim no Yakko") among the cadres of the fox factory.
The "Shabayashi no Yorin" and the "Big and Small Flaps" arose among the cadres of the company.

Wide cocoon to wooden paddle-based, or to chapter pulp-based? More fire factory, or more

small factory? This about "chapter book" size "and so on, in fact, Wang Wang development of bookmaking industry
of the two construction methods, such as "fast and economical" and "" less slow and poor cost? etc.
Over the years, many comrades have been repeatedly arguing that only wood pulp can be used to make good books.

Only with 100 percent of the pulp half can make offset printing gang, coral bag paper and industrial technology with curd, base to clothes for the general
With thin not must be matched with a certain amount of wood pulp. Their reasoning is that the world's production of Ying slanders more countries, fox-making raw materials of 100 percent of the
One hundred thousand ten percent of the raw materials for fox-making are more than wood. These comrades do not summarize the history of our country mainly rely on grass to make the fox test, but also look at the

They do not see the post-liberation inventions of the masses. They are guided by a number of dogmatic ideas that superstitiously believe in wood pulp and double-mindedly regard chapter pulp, not three,

I want to make full use of our country's rich variety of fox-making sources, but only ask the state to supply more wood. Because of the influence of this kind of thinking
As a result of the influence of this idea, fifteen thousand years ago, the Ministry of Light Industry put forward the "four-fourths of the fox pulp should be made of wood", well and village
The timber used for wolf-making accounted for 11.1 percent of the timber harvested in the country.

The volume of our waterwood is not large. According to the present abundant data, the forest volume of the country is more than seven million hectares, accounting for about one-third of the country's land area.
hectares, accounting for 10 percent of the country's land area (most of the countries in the world account for more than 2 percent), the volume of rose volume is
The total volume of the rose volume is 1.3 billion cubic meters, which is only about one tenth of the volume of the Soviet Union's rose volume. Although the volume of timber harvesting in China has been increasing year by year, the reforestation program is also increasing.
Although the volume of timber harvested in China has been increasing year by year, and the reforestation program is also developing, the demand for timber in all aspects of the country's economy has been growing faster, and the volume of timber needed for construction has been increasing year by year.
The amount of timber needed for consumption has been insufficient year after year. Since there is a shortage of timber supply, and we are seeking to use more timber for fox-making, this will inevitably lead to the relocation of the foil industry.
This inevitably constrained the development of the foil industry. Therefore, when the Ministry of Industry started to draw up the production target of the first five-year plan, it was planned that the production target of the first five-year plan would be increased in the year of 1977.
When the Ministry of Industry began to draw up the production target of the first five-year plan, it was planned that the annual output in 1962 would be only 1.5 million to 1.6 million tons, with an average annual growth rate of only 11 percent.
The average annual growth rate was only 11 percent. Because of the insufficient supply of timber, it was felt that there was still difficulty in accomplishing this task, and of course, a faster rate was not envisaged.
It was certainly not possible to envision a faster rate.

With the great leap forward in agricultural production and the development of the area, all kinds of grasses will become a letter in the Ha long. Therefore, as long as the fight for wood pulp
Therefore, as long as the superstition of wood pulp is defeated and grasses are fully utilized as raw materials, the development speed of China's fox-making industry can be greatly accelerated.

China's use of grass and longitudinal manufacturing power, has a long history, the use of chapter pulp as a mechanism of power, has also been a few decades of history.
History. At present, there are more than two hundred and twenty wolf factories in China, most of them use grass pulp to make madness, and there are less than ten of them use this pulp. Rose...
In the past few years, through the active creation of the masses of workers, there have been dozens of kinds of raw materials used formally in fox-making production.

We use the raw materials of the chapter to make children, farmers maple use these things as fuel, etching material and fertilizer, there is not a shield?
Is there a contradiction between us? It seems that there is a contradiction, but it can be solved. Because of the chapter used to make wolves, not a large proportion of class Yiwei, and Wei due to the
Fertilizer industry and the rapid development of the coal industry, the proportion of farmers using the chapter class for fuel, fertilizer will also be less and less alkaline. At the same

Calcium since the raw materials for fox making should be drum to grass type Xu Wei mainly, then we must solve the problem of whether to run a big three mainly or run a small factory mainly.
Ideas ask is. Zhang Yan Jiaoyuan is divided into a track, and it is not easy to centralize it. To utilize the secondary source of grass, it is appropriate to in the raw material production area
The construction of small factories, not declared to build a centralized production of large factories.

In the past, there are a lot of wenzhi, one-sidedly flocculation for the run of the big factory paper Ji reasonable, into the low, high quality, advanced technology. On the other hand
On the contrary, Xian for small factories can not be rough use of raw materials, and can not use new technology, technology, paper washing indicators backward, high cost, quality can not be guaranteed, double bad.
High, quality can not be guaranteed, double bad management. In fact, the fox produced by small factories, the quality is not bad, the cost is not necessarily high.
High, raw materials can be brown combined use, product variety is easy to adjust. Such as Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, Wang Liren Oil Factory, is a hundred or so

It can take materials locally, build factories everywhere in China, and force them to blossom, open the way for agricultural by-products and wild plants to be produced, and help the handicraft industry to develop a large number of technicians and help the handicraft industry.
We can train a large number of technicians and help the manual labor industry to carry out technological reforms, so that the industry, which accounts for one-fourth of our country's consumption output, can be expanded to include the following industries.

The industrialization of the industrial pan-wolf industry has played its due role in the country. The equipment of the small wide is simple, the investment required is less, the time of the baby is short, the
The company's revenue is fast. In the process of rectification, the Ministry of Light Industry, on the one hand, hemorrhoidal, on the other hand, in Beijing, started a daily output of two small factories, the investment responsibility of the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture.
A small factory with a daily production capacity of 2,000 tons, investing only 130,000 yuan (in other areas, the investment can be less), was completed and put into production in a month.

Three only threshold 140 million dollars. Therefore, the point of running a large or small factory, not wanting to run a small factory, is the end of the scale of shit.

Of course, this well is not such as in the future should not be evaluated to organize large-scale power plant. Choking raw material concentration, convenient transportation place, but also the promise of
Chance to organize some large factories, as the tungsten industry chi dry. Large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises recall the past, to small and medium-sized enterprises
The policy of mainly running small and medium-sized enterprises and more small factories is a complete and indivisible system. In order to implement this policy, we should
In terms of technology, old factories should help new factories, big factories should help small factories, mechanism factories should help handmade factories, and there should be a foundation for the fengshui industry.

The places that have a base in the manufacturing industry should help those that do not have a base yet.

In the past, in the department of centralized management of the manufacturing industry, there were many cancerous people who regarded the production technology of the manufacturing industry as very mysterious.
In the past, in the department of manufacturing industry managed by the central government, there were many people who regarded the production technology of manufacturing industry as very mysterious, and they thought that the local government could not control it, and the ink industry could not be organized. Not only did they not support local factories, but they also saw that there were more and more local factories in the market.

The "Four Shifts" in Developing Local Industries

In March this year Xuan Chongqing Municipal factories and mines and nine specialized Sichuan Province.
Held a collaborative visit, focusing on how to accelerate the development of local industry
The development of pro-issue will listen to the central enterprises with local enterprises above, and
With large and medium-sized enterprises with small enterprises, with existing enterprises capsule new
enterprises, and the "four belts" measure of taking advanced enterprises to take the backward enterprises.
And the following problems were solved.

I. All large and medium-sized factories in the city of Chontopia have been decided.
The task of the first to help the prefectures and counties to develop the people's industry. That is, the large and medium-sized factories in Chongqing Gong
Lice, medium-sized factories, to be in the Lan, within five years, the project to help the specialization of the Si
District and the county with the tiki, recruiting steel Zhan, non-ferrous father's bureau, electric power, coal, petrochemical, machinery and other industries.

To this end, the basin is limited to a piece of the package in, defend the Xi to the end of the method, answer each large,
Medium-sized factories have been designated to help the object, made a clear division of labor.

And Jie asked him to take responsibility for the industrial development of the prefecture or county, starting with planning.
industrial development, from the planning, to the mixing of a

small industrial point, and to help them to the end.
Secondly, three types of mutual cooperation in building factories were determined.
The first form was that the prefectures invested the responsibility, and the counties were given the responsibility. The first form is a special area to invest in the responsibility, the city to help organize. The wind is
The special zone itself has the conditions to organize the factory and mine, attack the special zone to organize, Chongqing Municipality should actively assist in the construction.
Chongqing Municipality to actively assist in the construction of no. The second form is the city investment,
The second form is that the city invests, and the special bar cuts help to organize. Where the investment crack days, high technology, the special area a moment
Can not afford to organize; and double for the production of construction of every necessary factory and mine, Chongqing Municipality
After obtaining the special zone's inquiry, you can invest in the special zone, and the special zone will actively assist in the construction of the mine.
The special zone villages actively assisted in the extension of no. The second form is that the prefecture and the city jointly
The second form is the joint organization of the prefecture and the city. Ponfei Cha Luanfeng window, the construction of the current mode than the grave large, more technically complex, more investment.
The construction projects that are technically more complex and with more investment, are organized by the two sides.
After consultation between the two sides, Chongqing Municipality and the prefecture can be jointly organized.
Third, determined the city and and area. County of customs in technology, stock preparation and raw materials and other aspects of mutual support

The big factories or the factories that had been developed by Fengshang six ways wanted to be merged and put under the direct management of the central government. We did not believe that the local government could manage the enterprises well.
Therefore, when the central government proposed to improve the system and help the enterprises, some of us were afraid that the local government could not manage the enterprises, and we were a bit worried about the decentralization.
We were a bit worried about decentralization. Facts have proved that this kind of abuse is all based on the facts. After the Xuanhua Consumption Factory was decentralized to Hebei Province, it was less than a year before the enterprise was scheduled to be attacked.
After the decentralization of Xuanhua factory to Hebei Province, within less than a year of planning, it attacked the local government. The way to help the local ancient set up a handful of small consumption factory. After the decentralization of many enterprises.
After the decentralization of many enterprises, due to the cooperation between the local agricultural and other industries, and the cooperation with the local government, they all did better than in the past. Only
Only by relying on the people can we develop the ice-making industry more quickly by utilizing our human, material and financial resources.
It's been a very difficult thing to do.                       It's a very good thing.

On the basis of the emancipation of ideas, I have taken on a new target of reaching 50,000 tons of production by the second year of the nineteen nineties, which is three times higher than the target set by the Plain Light God.
The target was set by the God of Plain Light at 3,000,000 tons. China's prison industry will develop by leaps and bounds just like any other business, and this is no longer possible.

According to the estimation of Weijiang Machinery Factory, it will cost more than one million dollars to build a new refining room with the same mold.
According to the capital structure, it needs more than one million dollars, and the parts it needs.
It's not possible to get a quick supply.

This shows that the next band is a good measure for the development of the earth's industry. It is a good measure to develop the industry.
This is a good way to build a factory, like the old mother of China.
The factory will be developed in the same way as a group, with a wide range of products.

Driven by, our country's aquatic industry has ditch is now the production of a great leap forward climax, aquatic research source of the unlimited potential of Ma Jiaojiu day bush
The unlimited potential of aquatic resources has been revealed day by day.

The development of the aquaculture industry is very important for improving people's living standards and increasing their income. Generally speaking, the
In general, except for the fat, the nutritional value of aquatic products is comparable to that of other foods, and the price is much lower. Each
A good aquaculture pond can produce about one thousand kilograms, its value is equal to three acres of rice. The production of aquatic products
The production of aquatic products has the advantages of low investment, fast yield, high yield and does not take up arable land. Mud Fujian province planning, only Jia put can culture sea
The annual output of 1.4 million tons of kelp can be produced by utilizing 300,000 mu of shallow sea water, and its output value is equal to 1.5 billion pounds of rice.
The output value of kelp is equal to one hundred million pounds of rice. According to the calculation of Hubei Province, as long as we utilize the 19 million acres of water surface in the province, each acre of water surface can produce 1.4 million tons of kelp per year.

If the average production of only one hundred pounds of aquatic products, the production of good will have more than 400 million yuan, can be used to buy 100,000 tractors to support agricultural technology.

Reform. An Min from all over the world because he saw the great potential of aquatic resources and its role in agricultural construction and people's livelihood, and he put forward the idea of "turning to the water".
put forward the "to the water for Ran irrigation, transfer water for tractors and chemical fertilizers? The slogan of "Ask for tractor and chemical fertilizer in the water" was put forward.

China's production of aquatic products, but also lower than many countries in the world water in. Ken before people double the world's annual output of various aquatic products
The total annual output of all kinds of aquatic products in the world is two to nine million clear, an average of twenty-one city hall per person, while China's average per person is only nine city catty.

Does our country have the conditions to greatly increase the production of aquatic products? My answer is yes. According to our knowledge
According to our knowledge, from the area available for aquaculture seaport, shallow sea in one dry five million lets above; available for aquaculture river, lakes, ponds,
Reservoirs and reservoirs have a total of 100 million tons; the coast has Chaohai Bay, Dawei, Bone Out, Zhandong, Beibu Gulf, a large injection field, and dozens of small and medium-sized fish farms, as well as a number of small and medium-sized fish farms.
There are dozens of small and medium-sized fish farms along the coast. If the area of seawater culture reaches 10 million provinces, the ancient average to produce three thousand kilograms, the total output
If the area of freshwater aquaculture reaches 80 million mu, the average mu yield will be 400 kilograms, and the total output will be 1,000,000,000 tons.
The area of freshwater aquaculture has reached 80 million mu, with an average yield of 400 catties per mu and a total production of 10 million tons; the area of fish farming has reached 100 million mu, with an average yield of 20 catties per mu and a total production of 10 million tons. In terms of marine fishing
According to the estimation of the fishery, three million tons of fish can be caught every year. The above total, our country can produce 3,000,000 tons of aquatic products every year.
Guan million tons or so. Therefore, we believe that the development of aquatic products production is not only necessary, but also complete and organized.
The

| | | | | |
In order to check the development of aquaculture business, nine should mainly rely on the first national monopoly, the implementation of centralized management, to the deep-sea pelagic development, and
The other opinion is that the fishery industry should be centralized and centralized management should be carried out. The other opinion is in favor of cooperation with the local authorities, decentralization of management, inland and offshore development of all water surfaces, inland and offshore development, and inland and offshore development of all water surfaces, inland and offshore development.
The other opinion is that we should decentralize the management to the localities and develop inland and offshore waters, and focus on aquaculture in the wells. This is an equalization of two ideas and western methods.

On the question of state-run or co-operative organization, one opinion is that state-run is a system of ownership by the people, and co-operative organization is a system of collective ownership, while collective ownership is a system of ownership by the people.
ownership, and collective ownership should be replaced by people's ownership, and therefore the main focus should be on the state-run industry.
Therefore, the main focus should be placed on state-owned enterprises. Another view was that the production of aquatic products had always been a very extensive mass production enterprise. Aquatic products
Of the total output of aquatic products, the state-run enterprises accounted for only about 20%, and most of it came from the mass production; the state-run enterprises had only 20,000 employees, while the country had 40,000 employees.
There are only 20,000 employees in state-run enterprises, while there are 4.5 million professional fishermen and many more farmers in the country; there are only 400 state-run saloons, while there are 10,000 coastal saloons; and there are only 2,000 fishermen in the country.
The number of state-run enterprises is only 400, while there are more than 100,000 coastal fishermen, and the number of state-run employees is too small to solve the current problems.
This is a very small number and cannot solve the current problems. China's various water surfaces are so many and widely distributed, and a great part of the aquaculture industry has never been a part of agriculture.
The aquaculture industry is a side business of the agricultural industry, which does not rely on the millions of talents and hundreds of millions of creeps, and does not rely on the cooperation of the
It is impossible to develop China's aquaculture industry without relying on millions of talents and hundreds of millions of people in the industry, and without relying on and cooperating with the great efforts, financial resources, material resources and wisdom of the people.

On the question of centralized or decentralized management by the central ministry, one intention is to emphasize the importance of the system as a self-contained system.
One opinion is to emphasize that the management should be centralized and decentralized. One opinion is to strongly advocate the decentralization of management to the local level.

"On the question of ocean-going fishing or offshore fishing, one opinion is that the future of the fishing industry lies in the ocean, and it is important to plan for the development of the fishing industry in the ocean beforehand.
One opinion is that the future of the industry is the ocean, so we should plan to go fishing in the ocean beforehand. Another opinion is that, except for whales, sea chests, fur seals, etc., the oceanic fishery should be planned for offshore fishing beforehand.
In the ocean, except for whales, sea chests, fur seals, etc. in the deep sea, generally all kinds of products are in the coastal area, and fishing in the ocean, the investment is relatively large, the income is relatively small.
Small, which is not cost-effective in our country at present. Many countries in the world have different reasons and purposes for developing offshore fishing.
different reasons and purposes. For example, some socialist countries are due to the lack of sufficient fishing grounds in their own countries, and need to develop offshore fishing in order to satisfy the people's demand for aquatic products.
They need to develop their fishing grounds in order to satisfy their people's need for aquatic products. In the case of the United States, Britain and other imperialist countries, their distant-water fishing was
They are linked to their foreign expansion policy. Their distant continents are often in fact the coastal waters of other countries.
The situation of our aquaculture industry is different from that of the imperialist countries which need to hunt danger in the distant seas, and even more different from that of the United States and Britain, therefore, the ocean broadcasting is not the same as that of other countries.
The United States and the United Kingdom, therefore, the policy of ocean broadcasting should be mainly offshore, make full use of our existing injection field, restore the existing fishing grounds.
We should make full use of our existing fishing grounds, restore the existing fishing grounds, open up new fishing grounds in the South China Sea, vigorously accelerate the mechanization of turbid ships, and accumulate the latest fishing techniques, and strive to improve offshore production.
We will make full use of our existing fishing grounds to restore the existing fishing grounds in Dangqing and open up new fishing grounds in the South China Sea. Strengthen the breeding and protection of bean sources, and consolidate the coastal production.
When the conditions are favorable, the fishing industry should of course be developed appropriately.

In the development of aquatic production should be visited for a long time fishing-oriented, or aquaculture-oriented open question. One kind of intention is that, at present
The total output of the world's aquatic products, aquaculture production is only ten percent, and most of the hard is marine fishing, foreign scientific documents are mostly like to capture the community, rarely effect to aquaculture.
Scientific documents in foreign countries are mostly like to capture society, rarely effect to culture. Therefore, our country should also "according to the original appropriate science? to marine fishing
and do not need to mobilize the masses for aquaculture. Most of the people who advocate this idea are technicians who have studied in Japan, Britain and the United States.
The majority of those who advocated this idea were technicians who had studied in Japan, Britain and the United States. Another opinion is that, according to the specific situation of our country, the production of aquatic products should be heavily subsidized.

Must be to raise the main electronic, rich provinces, prefectures, counties, can each according to the specific conditions, to move the main Zhi Zhi Sai. Raise and all.
Because most of China is in the Cascade belt, subtropical, aquatic chapter of the Kai breeding and growth are very fast. China can be cultured Han
Sea beaches and harbor area of a steam million Lei, currently also commissioned the use of more than 10,000,000 Lei, available for aquaculture of freshwater area of Huang
The area of fresh water available for aquaculture is 100 million yuan, but at present, it is only utilized and roughly 1,000 spots sound more than 10,000,000 south, and if these waters are fully utilized, the annual output can be more than three times.
More than ten million Gu, can be a culture of the potential of the source is very large. In addition, our country is a country with a thousand years of farming tradition, especially in freshwater aquaculture.
In particular, freshwater aquaculture is very half. Therefore, the culture-based approach is in line with the specific situation of our country.
Only by firmly following the path of the masses and mobilizing the vast number of cooperators and the masses of families to develop seawater and freshwater aquaculture, we can make our country's aquaculture a success.
The aquaculture industry of our country will be able to make a leap forward.

From this, we can see that the above two ideas and methods are the two approaches to the development of aquaculture.
The two ideas and methods mentioned above are also two approaches to the development of the aquaculture industry. This Yu Sui, in the past quite a long period of time, Xia has not been well resolved. The fact is that when I
When we are still bound by the wrong thinking and have not been liberated, the aquaculture industry can not make great strides forward. For example.

The target of over one million tons could not be set. After the power

We started the second five-year plan, but we could only make a circle between 4.5 million tons and 1.52 million tons.

The workers of Huamin factory thought a lot.

The workers of Huamin factory thought a lot and used poor methods to innovate the technology. He.

The small factory of six people made a big technical innovation. They spent only thirty dollars and made a tax of two million dollars.

The Shanghai Hua Zhan Zhong Mechanical Industry Association is a small factory with only six employees.
All the production equipment was only a lathe, a quarter wrench, a press, and a hand-held machine.
The factory had only one lathe, one quarter-trigger, one punching machine, one hand press, and five nickel tigers.
The total production capacity was only one lathe, one wrench, one punch press and one hand press, and five nickel tigers. The total number of products in the factory was. J. 1580 Model 1580 pneumatic automatic
The need for a pneumatic press is significant, but the company is not able to produce this type of machine due to the lack of equipment.
However, due to the outdated equipment, this product could not meet the requirements of various aspects.
After the implementation of the measures to improve and innovate the technology in the city, the workers of the factory started to work hard to improve the technology.
After the opening of the city, the workers of the factory were all very ambitious, and they promised that they would make their own standards.
They promised that they would put forward their own goals: to actively research and innovate, and to make the operation of the factory more efficient.
They promised to actively research and innovate technology, to change manual labor into light manual labor, and to make the factory more efficient by the end of the year.
The annual production of tools was basically changed within a year.
The tools of production were basically changed within a year.

Six major technological innovations.
Productivity generally increased ~ - understand to 25 times, the highest increase of
The highest increase is ten times. Among the sixteen technical measures taken.
There are a group of more than one is not to spend a cent bar, the workers themselves to improve. Such as the past production
For example, in the past, the manufacture of automatic controllers and pieces of "ripe Zhan flange", is to use the insertion and extraction of the machine under the pressure.
No sixteen hours to do only four, and the labor intensity is very high.
High, Portugal through the Italian Dougen masters changed to use the smell of the press, six hours to make a hundred.
After changing to the press, he made 100 pieces in 6 hours, which was 15 times more efficient. Another kind of rare piece is the "three-legged
Three-legged", in the past, the output was low and the quality was poor.
Three workers worked together to make the manganese, but by using a visualizer, the output has increased by 20 times, and the quantity and quality have improved.
The quantity of paralyzed and the appearance of the products have reached the first-class level.
There are some technical problems and strong preparation problems that can't be solved by the factory alone, so they take the initiative to go out and wait for the factory to solve them.
If they can't be solved, they take the initiative to go out and wait for the center factory and brother factories to solve them.

is also still far behind objective reality.

We have some comrades, over-excited in the development of aquaculture business of two ideas, two methods of birth, so can't
In time to overcome the wrong thinking, adhere to the positive will be looking for, is due to the number of stripes and light experimentalism, the Chinese aquaculture industry, the characteristics of the training Ji insufficient, do not dare to put the Chinese aquaculture industry, the characteristics of the training Ji insufficient.
The reason why we can't overcome the wrong ideas in time and insist on the right way is that we are bound by the principle and the light experimentalism, and we don't have enough training on the characteristics of Chinese aquaculture industry, and we don't dare to put the past Zhuhang into the high level of principle. This is a deep lesson for us.
This is a deep lesson for us.

Both through the rectification movement, especially the second meeting of the party's National People's Congress, we thought of the liberation, the party to find a clear son, aquaculture
The situation of the great leap forward of the aquaculture industry also appeared. This year's provincial plans have reached more than five million tons of real souls.
This target can exceed that of Japan, which has the highest aquatic product output among the present-day capitalist countries, that is to say, the stock can exceed that of all the capitalist countries.
In other words, the production of fish products can exceed that of all the capitalist countries in the world. On this basis, it is possible for us to make the output of aquatic products in 1962 reach more than one million tons, equal to the current level of production.
more than one million square tons, equal to one-half of the total fish production of the world at present. Under the guidance of the Party committees at all levels, the Fubi
With the guidance of the Party committees at all levels and with the human, material and intellectual resources of the masses, the Party's general approach to building bamboo society is being steadily implemented, based on cooperation, decentralization of management, and the development of the aquaculture industry.
We have been able to solve a series of problems in the development of the aquaculture industry through cooperation, decentralization of management, inland and offshore development of all water surfaces, and aquaculture as the mainstay of the aquaculture industry.
By solving a series of problems in the development of the aquaculture industry, we will surely be able to realize the above-mentioned glorious tasks.

- I am sure that we will be able to realize the above honorable tasks.
The support of the authorization. When the factory did not have a bed, they went to the center of the factory to find support.
The center of the factory is closed on the day of the week, so they go to the center of the factory for support. They went to the center of the factory to get support, so they went to the center of the factory to get support. The problem of the lack of equipment was solved.
The problem of the lack of equipment was solved without the use of six pieces of equipment, and the problem of the lack of equipment was solved without the use of six pieces of equipment.
I've got it.             (LAUGHING)                            How refreshing.
They're always doing the most with the least, the most with the least.
They're always doing the most with the least. For example, in order to improve two molds, they needed steel, so they bought a new one to catch up.
In order to improve the molds, the workers would go on a Sunday yard sale, rejecting the old molds in the scrapyard.
To the category of the old mold expansion, only Ding more than four dollars, Jiguo and the new handover a happy bad Kepler.
The same thing. Another example is that in order to compensate for the lack of equipment in the bed, they only spent
In order to make up for the lack of equipment, they only spent ten dollars to buy two mesh wrenches, and used their spare time to make a milling tool.
There are pages of people who have made a one-person guide to the meter.                    Terashita and Ben
The facts of the factory vividly illustrate that no matter how bad the factory is, if it is not in a hurry, it can still be a place where technology and innovation can flourish.
We can also make a great deal of technology and innovation, not to spend or spend less, there are two ladders up to the sky, and we can make the technological reform a great success.
We can make technological reforms a success. This is also the only thing that can be traced back to the past.
The kind of technology and innovation must spend money, spend less money to get it done, or spend less money to get it done, or spend less money to get it done, or spend less money to get it done, or spend less money to get it done.
The one-sided view that money can't be spent.                                    (Shanghai: Zheng Chengyi)

 internal reality, or from subjectivity?
The hole and the label

Whether to work from the practical point of view and use the materialistic viewpoint or to work from the subjective point of view and use the subjectivist and metaphysical viewpoint, under the same objective conditions, in the cause of socialist construction, there are two different ways of doing things.
Under the same objective conditions, in the cause of socialist construction, what we get are two very different kinds of results.
Under the same objective conditions, in the cause of socialist construction, we will get two very different kinds of results. One is much faster and better than the other, while the other is much weirder and worse than the other.

In the fox-making industry, the word "grass" and "mori" are used, while in the aquaculture industry, the word "yankee" and "shun" are used. "and so on, in the aquaculture business, and in the aquaculture business, with vivid
This truth has been demonstrated with vivid and powerful facts. When one looks at and deals with half of the world with a subjectivist and metaphysical way of thinking, the first Five-Year Plan is not a good idea.
When the first Five-Year Plan's production target of one million tons was not exceeded, the aquatic production target of four hundred and fifty tons was not exceeded, and the production target of one million tons was not exceeded.
The production target of aquatic products could not break through the four and a half million tons of sedan chair. Later, he analyzed the objective situation by applying the method of materialism and defense.
Developed a positive working policy, the fine fruit, nineteen days two years of consumption production target raised to five million tons, will greatly exceed the United Kingdom; this year's aquatic products
This year's aquatic production target has exceeded five million tons, and the target of the second five-year plan has been raised to more than two million tons.
The second Five-Year Plan target was raised to two million tons, and China's aquatic production will leap to the top of the world.

The example of these two ministries, women's agriculture, gold industry, chemical industry, petroleum industry and so on countless similar examples.
We must carry on the struggle to break down subjectivism and establish dialectical materialism that has already begun in our thinking.
We must carry on the fight against subjectivism and dialectical materialism that has already been waged in the This great victory will help us to build socialism faster than anyone could have imagined.

Dialectical materialism is different from dogmatism and shamanism. The dogmatists are superstitious about poisonous books, about foreign countries, and about

They believe in their own outdated and narrow-minded experiments. Dialectical materialists, on the other hand, emphasize the objective reality, and have the opportunity to formulate work plans and methods.
In order to formulate work plans, methods and approaches, one must start from the actual situation and take into account the characteristics of China.
In developing the home industry and organizing local industries in a prefecture or county, we must take into account the characteristics of China.

The development of local industries in a prefecture or county must take into account the characteristics of the prefecture or county. Undoubtedly, we will always take into account the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and we will always emphasize the importance of the principles of Marxism-Leninism in the development of local industries.

The general principles of the Marxism-Leninism. What we must do is to combine principle with spirituality, and to combine general principles with concrete practice.
We must combine principle with spirituality, and combine universal principles with concrete practice. We will always emphasize the experience of our predecessors, of foreign countries, and of our own past. However, we will never let these
We will never let ourselves be bound by these experiments. In the cause of socialist construction, only programs, guidelines and methods formulated in the light of actual practice and in conformity with the laws of subculture can maximize the effectiveness of our work.
- In the cause of socialist construction, it is only by means of plans, guidelines and methods formulated in accordance with actual practice and in conformity with the laws of the subculture that we can make the best use of the objective favorable conditions and seek to serve the cause of socialist construction.
It is only through the full utilization of objective favourable conditions to serve the cause of socialist construction, and through the full utilization of all the forces and positive factors of socialism that the speed of socialist construction can be accelerated.

Some of the spokesmen of the fox industry and the aquaculture sector were at first blinded by dogmatism. They had to, and they did.
Since all the countries in the world make raw materials out of pulp, and the shipping industry is based on ocean-going fishing, we have to do the same.

-In 1958.

| In 1958
The first way to do so, and then the cabinet has the first road. And with wooden oars to get the fox, it is going to be limited by our timber Qinjian not much! Oceangoing
To expand, we have to build a big general, spend mutual amount of investment table. In this way, the development speed of fox-making industry and aquaculture naturally cannot grow up quickly.
The development of fox-making industry and fishery business naturally could not grow up quickly. The thinking method of some other comrades was not like this. They started from the actual situation of our country, and partly
In terms of raw materials for ice-making, the Principality of Taibu is a very rich source, and our country has been relying on ice-making for more than two years.
In terms of aquaculture, our country has good climatic conditions and a lot of water for aquaculture, and there are also many years of aquaculture in the country.
Therefore, they advocate that in the industry of migratory thinning should take grasses and more raw materials as the main policy, and in the aquaculture business should take the world's raw materials as the main policy.
Therefore, they advocated that the aquaculture industry should adopt the policy of focusing on grasses and raw materials and the aquaculture industry should adopt the policy of focusing on aquaculture. In this way, the development of these two kinds of business is faster than the implementation of the former policy, can be three times faster.
In this way, the speed of development of these two businesses will be three, four, to five, or even three times faster than the implementation of the previous policy. These two examples vividly illustrate the point. The same
The two examples vividly illustrate how different results can be obtained from the same objective conditions, from the practical approach and from several approaches.

Of course, the materialistic approach is fundamentally opposite to revisionism. Revisionists boast of their "originality".
In reality, what they call "originality" is nothing but a piece of cloth used to stifle their own beliefs in the principles of universalism and Leninism.
The "originality" they give is just a piece of cloth to cover up their own backwardness to the principles of Prabhavism and Leninism, and to hide their own superstitious beliefs about the fundamentalism. The dialectical materialists have a spirit of total
The spirit of creation of the dialectical materialists is based on reality, seeking truth from facts and conforming to objective laws. It is this spirit of creation that is responsible for
It is this spirit of creativity that is responsible for the transformation of nature and the advancement of society. Because the objective reality is the richest and most varied, the dialectical materialists who emphasize the objective reality are the richest and the most varied.
Dialectical materialists are the most creative. The wisdom of those who have mastered the law of materialism is boundless.

The materialistic method is incompatible with the optimization and stagnation of thought. It begs people's thoughts to constantly wow jung injustice view
The actual change and change. Only mechanical materialism sees objective things as unchanging. Comrade Mao Handong
Comrade Mao Handong said in his "Practical Heaven": "Any process, not only belonging to nature and society, but also due to internal contradictions and struggles, is moving forward.
All processes, not only in nature and society, but also due to internal contradictions and struggles, move forward and develop, and so should the movement of human beings. According to the social movement.
The guidance of a true revolution lies not only in the need to correct one's own thinking, reasoning, planning, and methods when they are wrong, but also in the need to correct one's own thinking, reasoning, planning, and methods when they are wrong, as we have seen above.

When a certain objective process has moved from one stage of development to another, we must be able to make ourselves and all those who are participating in the revolution follow the change in subjective awareness, i.e., to make the new process work.
That is to say, we have to make the new revolutionary tasks and the new program of work suitable for the new situation. Revolutionary Period
The situation changes very rapidly, and if the revolutionaries cannot change rapidly with it, they will not be able to lead the revolution to victory.
to victory." Some of the comrades in the industrial sector have in fact spasmodically created small well run factories and produced high quality products made from the articles and covenants.
Some comrades in the industrial sector are still against the development of small factories and strawberries when in fact there are already very well run small factories, producing high quality products made from articles and treaties. He can not see the local run industry's active
In fact, it is a manifestation of the backwardness of thought in reality. There are also some colleagues in the Ministry of Fisheries who advocate that the fishery industry should only be operated by the state.
Some colleagues in the Ministry of Fisheries also advocate that the fishery industry should be mainly state-run, and do not favor that it should be mainly run by cooperatives. The basic reason for this is also that the idea lags behind the reality.
The basic reason for this is that their thinking lags behind the actual situation, that they have underestimated the high degree of enthusiasm generated by the peasants after the realization of cooperativization, and that they are still observing the problem in accordance with the quality and quality of the backward small peasant economy.
The reason for this was also that the mindset was backward.

Our country is now in an unusual time of rapid change. In the economic, political and ideological contexts of the

After the Yuyi Revolution was basically completed, the liberated productive forces moved forward by leaps and bounds. New records, new indicators.
New records, new indicators, often within a few days there is another market. New creations, new signs, often the least conservative people have to be
tongue. Under these circumstances, if we are very alert to the new changes in our work, we are afraid that we will be unable to keep abreast of the latest developments.

If we can catch the new changes in the actual work (even if it is a sandstorm), and supplement, improve, and modify our plans and methods of work in due time, then we will be able to keep up with the changes in our plans and methods of work.

The speed of the construction of the madness will be accelerated continuously. On the contrary, if we are not smart enough, we will miss the opportunity if we fall behind the actual situation for a while.
If we are not smart enough, even if we fall behind the actual situation, we will miss the time, so that the factors that can optimize the construction of traditional socialism cannot be distributed, and the precious time will be lost quietly.
The compensation quietly dropped from the hands. During this period, the practice of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry drew special attention from us. Metallurgical industry
The comrades of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry paid attention to the changes of the situation, and once they found the factors that could move the speed of the development of the gold-medicine industry, they seized it and utilized it to their advantage.
They seized it and made use of it. He fully relied on the enthusiasm of the Hongfang to run small mesh factories and open small mines, and raised the development speed of the metallurgical industry to an alarming level.
The speed of development of the industry has reached an astonishing level. Many people said, "Now the gold industry is getting better and better every day." We
We can take this statement as the right-hand saying for all the units in the Ministry of Gold Industry in the day's leap forward. At the present time we are in a situation of
In the present situation we are in, for the dialectical materialists who are advancing with the fashion, we should be inclined to collect new nutrients, believe in the new concepts, and think about the new concepts.
and the belief in new developments in the world.                   The

Dialectical materialism attaches great importance to the role of human thought and human subjective initiative. Dialectical materialism less sore for that
The objective law of development of your thing is not transferable by the will of the sky, but people can make full use of the objective law to change the nature and transform the society.
nature and transform society. The idea of the objective law, the first for the masses of people to grasp, can be turned into a material force to move out of the side of the sea.
The idea of the objective law is mastered by the masses, and can be transformed into the material power to move out of the sea. In "The Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary Warfare", Mr. Zafuidong said, "The success or failure of a war committee is mainly determined by the
It is true that the success or failure of a war committee is mainly determined by the military, political, economic and natural conditions of the two sides in the first battle. However, not only that, it also depends on the subjective guidance of both sides.
However, it also depends on the ability of both sides to provide subjective guidance. A strategist cannot attempt to win a war by exceeding the material conditions, but a militarist can.
However, a military man can, but must, win the war within the material conditions that allow him to do so. The downfall of a military man is based on the objective material conditions.
The downfall of a military man is based on the objective material conditions, but the military man can direct a lot of powerful and colorful activities with the help of this platform.
The military can direct a lot of heroic and colorful campaigns. Starting from the actual situation, starting with a big tire, working boldly, and building on the side of a big platform, this is a proof of the law aba
This is the attitude of the respondent. The opposite of this attitude: the eyes only see the objective conditions of the limitations, the spirit of Lingku not pull, and the spirit of the world's most important people, the spirit of the world's most important people.
This is a misguided attempt to take advantage of those who can learn politics and should be able to fly and so on. Under the same objective conditions, give full play to human subjective
Under the same objective conditions, if we give full play to human initiative, or if we abolish the extremely conservative attitude, we will get different results, which is what we have learned from 1956,
We can see this clearly in the three years of 1956, 1957 and 1988, when the national loi was in full bloom.

Now, the Foundation chapter on the glazing industry and the aquaculture industry gives us another vivid picture of this situation.

The chapter on the manufacturing industry and the aquaculture industry now brings us back to this stark contrast with vivid facts.

This year, this province of Lake, wheat and other real crops, another bumper harvest. And the total grain output of the summer harvest may reach seventy
billion halls, which will increase production by more than three billion pounds over the year of days. If not in April 1-10 around left over a ice up, wind against and
Against the seed more than ten days of direct rain, the total production may reach eight billion pounds. This year's summer crop, and to be the best of the cloudy area.
The total production may reach more than three billion hall, will be more than last year overproduction of more than ten billion help.

In order to timely total fine race the area small to the abundant production suburb test, Liu early cloth Gan winter pool seeding, in order to make good banana preparation, pressure to take the next year's summer production again a big leap.
Next year's summer production again a big leap forward. To this end, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee on May 5 to May 17 Chang Hu to team Can
held an on-site meeting. Participating in this meeting were the responsible comrades of the provincial fall, the first of the local and county committees, the responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the province and the responsible comrades of the county committees.
Specialized area of the department in charge of the comrades and agricultural experts and other more than two hundred people. This meeting visit is basically walking to open inquiry "is looking at
Opened, the dragon in the field cancer opened. We took the side visit, . Side debate, side total thousand, side arrangement method, strong base in the
The present Liu visit to learn. The meeting lied this spent nine days, in six counties to visit, in 100,000 agricultural into and Wang a local
Fang Guozhao farms on the household to observe flowers. This kind of walking to observe flowers and the lower bureau to observe the flowers and the border method, in not owes before held Hu Province
Agricultural production inspection, received a good effect, in this scene will boat, double received a crazy material good effect.
The results were very good. This has made us realize that the method of "going to the bureau to observe the flowers" and "going down to the bureau to observe the flowers" as instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong is very suitable for
for production campaigns on the scale of imitation guided fires.

This district meeting was very good and very fruitful. Through the on-site visit, we have broken down several beliefs about small-scale production and have learned a great deal about small-scale production.
We learned the advanced experience of small tip cultivation, and studied and arranged the winter sowing.

Before the meeting visit, many comrades on wheat production there are a lot of superstitious view imitation. For example. "small go is a low-yield crop.
Can't pass the jack pass" "Gangland two quality Jing thin, people less land, labor is not, small miniatures can't be a large area quotient abundance of production"
"large mountain slopes wheat can not be a large area of quota yield" "paddy fields of small talent can not be high yield" and so on. These wrong
viewpoints were criticized in this on-site bribery view.

How can change * small friend is a low-yield crop, can not pass the jack"? From Suixian ~ - walk test Gucheng, in the whole more than five hundred Huahei

Within the area, there are plains, granite fields, and large mountainous areas, where wheat grows like that Fanwang, with dense rows and thick, large-grain levies.
Moreover, each county has some high-yielding typical high-yield of more than 1,000 halls, and, if there is no disaster, there may be a small mu yield of more than double halls.
Kao*. Gucheng, No Yang, Guanghua, bamboo curses, Zhi Martyr City, five letter counties and cities, this year's summer harvest grain production, not only than last year's summer harvest
Grain output pingga one person almost more, but also can catch up with last year's total output of food in the public year, decided to show their "a quarter to fish public

year" slogan. Take Zhengyang County as an example, Drum County this year's total summer harvest stove food production is expected to reach more than 700 million pounds, more than last year's total grain output of five years.
Knocking County to the year's total food production of 500 million pounds more than 200 million pounds. This played his "wheat is a low-yield crop, can not pass the thousand pounds off" -

The superstition.

How can we say that "the wheat in Gangdi can't produce abundantly in a large area"? In the northern part of Xiangyang County, there is a plateau with a square map of more than a hundred miles.
Gangland, soil fall, fewer people, more land, labor shortage, Jie Lai are widely planted Surabaya harvest, Gui Di fall Bodhi is also a lot of, in the past
is a famous low-yield area, each mu of wheat production of only forty pounds to five pounds. But this year, this area of wheat, also won
Got an unprecedented bumper harvest. For example, in the agricultural society of the Gangpai less grain, all the arable land is Gangdian, the soil is thin, and there are fewer people and more land.
The soil was thin, the people were few and the land was plentiful, and each laborer had an average of ten hectares of arable land to cultivate. In 1956, the average yield per acre was only 7.6 tons.
In 1956, the average yield per mu was only 76 catties, and the average yield per mu in the year of the great harvest was only 160 catties in the year of the great harvest of 15,000 years. This year, the average wheat yield of this Zhu is high.

May reach more than four pounds, the total output of summer harvest grain pseudo output may reach seven million halls to eight million pounds, open last year the Zhu to the annual grain.

The total food production of 3.5 million pounds last year turned over a lot. This fact, once again, vividly illustrates the "hard work of the people and the ground does not fit" this
Exposure reasoning. At the same time, it also strongly breaks the superstition that the wheat in Gangdi can't have high yield.

How can we avoid the "big out of the area of the slope of the small can not be a large area of high beacon yield? Zhuxi County in the large register area, this year also won the
A big harvest in front of the window. The total output is worse than last year's one sex, the mountain appeared a lot of mu produce kilograms of wheat ten land, may also be

small charcoal, also appeared to produce straight yields of more than yi gang by type. This beat the big by the district of the slope of the wheat can not be a large area of high chrome make
The superstition of the production.

How can the wheat of the water fish not have a high yield? Gucheng County new life agricultural type wheat also has the same
The wheat also has the same type of mine to produce pounds. What is particularly interesting is that the 11th production team, the enterprise layer is two inches deep and the bottom is a pebble field.
The wheat planted in the field with two inches of depth and pebbles underneath yielded more than 800 pounds per acre. This breaks the myth that paddy wheat can't be high-fronted and productive.
The medium.

Most of the vouchers plus the comrades and also diverted to visit the yellow hernia area of Luo city with and new sand county large area of suburb including abundant production of wheat, strengthened in the rainy season.
Wheat, strengthened in the more rainy Yangtze River two rocky areas can also get wheat large areas of high yield confidence.

Some home industry technical cadres, superstitious and long, superstitious past, Jing abide by stereotypes, resting on the status quo, do not believe in the masses of knowledge and power.
They don't believe in the knowledge and power of the masses, and they don't believe in the new creations in the production practice of Jiang Jiang, even in the face of the wheat fields which have a yield of more than one kilogram per mu, they still have the confidence that they can get a high and abundant yield of wheat in large areas.

No ancestral invasion; their reasoning was, "There is no record of such a high level in the world?" It's as if the old world record is not even possible. It's as if the old world record is simply not
As if the old world record could not be surpassed by Rui's. And some of the cadres who do not weave deeply into agricultural production, influenced by these people, will not dare to boldly
The first step is to break this kind of paper-testingism and counting. Breaking this kind of paper-testing and counting is a very important task in the agricultural production war.
This is a very important task in the war of agricultural production. Many of the old beliefs left over from the old China and the old society have been in the minds of the people. In the new situation of agricultural production

It was possible to make agricultural production develop at a higher or highest rate. In the Gongyang area and other areas, there were many instances of superstitious beliefs.
The case of the Great Leap Forward in harvesting is one of the most convincing examples of this.

Through this visit, the comrades present at the meeting unanimously agreed that the potential for increasing the yield of the summer crop is very great. Only the village has the determination to increase
Cultivation of work, appropriate measures, any area of the small test, can get a large area of high yield. In some places, the wheat of the

The main reason why some places still haven't broken the low-yield situation should be changed, the main liver problem is that the secluded guide is not strong enough, the superstition is not glazed over, and the thought is that the wheat crop can be produced in a large area with high yields.

Not emancipated, therefore, in the two small test production guide, the lack of consistency to the end of the dry bar and bold technical innovation of the
The main problem is that the guidance is ineffective, because the superstition has not been eliminated.

 In the wheat h | to effectively do, learn from the deep plowing experience in Henan Province Changcheng County, foreign deep plowing, get the

The most important thing is to sow the seeds at the right time and plant them in dense rows, so that the average seeding per acre can reach twenty to twenty-five kilograms: to apply sufficient seeding.

It is also a good idea to keep the plant in good condition, and to keep the plant in good condition.

However, there is no good solution to the problem of preventing the collapse of wheat. This year, most of our province

The cause of the collapse and on the prevention of the correct approach.      The

Through the present dust situation, we also preliminary study and arrangement of this year's winter Pan species group planning. The province plans to plant 2,500 square meters of pandas this winter.

There is no doubt that the realization of the above plan will require great efforts and measures to ensure it.

Many comrades thought that it was necessary and timely to hold such a meeting at this time, that is, before the harvest.
It's timely. Mao Zedong told us: "Do not fight unprepared, and in terms of agricultural production, take measures as early as possible. Mao Zedong told us: "We should not make preparations for the agricultural production of silicon.
This is one of the keys to realizing the Great Shame. Our preliminary plan for winter sowing now will make it easier for us to prepare the acid in the

We can widely consult the masses and concentrate their wisdom so that we can make adequate preparations in terms of ideas, technology and materials.

Moreover, it can guide the initiative and planning of agricultural production, facilitate the comprehensive arrangement of sowing areas for various crops, and make decisions on the accumulation of last season's crops.
It can also help to solve the contradiction between planting last season's crops and planting next season's crops. At the same time, the total gray harvest, cloth medical winter sowing capsule, for the current
The current agricultural production is also a big move. I intend to adopt this approach for the production of water, cotton and oilseed crops in the future.

Last winter and spring in Gansu and the provincial group plan this year to produce four hundred kilograms of grain on the too
The county, city Yao thirty-five, accounting for the pseudo-provincial county, the city of the total number of a person in more than

The average yield of these counties and cities in 1977 was one hundred and ten ping and one hundred and ten pounds per mu.
There are four counties with an average yield of one hundred kilograms and four counties with an average yield of one hundred quintals and eleven kilograms and two hundred kilograms.
Five of the two under the field one catty to three hundred gang, there are ten three hundred and one catty
The last four hundred pounds, there are days; more than four hundred pounds, there are ice. Power
The average mu yield of these thirty counties and municipalities has reached 100 catties or more than 400 catties, which is a driving force for the public.
More than four hundred catties, is to drive the agricultural production of the province a great leap forward an important section.

According to the instructions of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Tianshui Local Committee

Tianshui, Tianshui, Tianshui City, Li County, Prophecy and other seven counties and cities. In each county and city, we checked the first and second,
In each county and city, we inspected the top, middle, and bottom types of crops of the three types of lets and Jeondi and Tiandi; we inspected more than one dozen agricultural garlics and more than one hundred farmers; finally, we inspected the top, middle, and bottom types of crops in Za'an.
Finally, the evaluation was held in the town of Za County.

From the report, although some of the original yield was very low, and some counties suffered from freezing and drought in spring, the increase in production was recognized.
But the increase in production is planned to be done very well, as long as the earning prongs drum up enough dry stems, grasp the fingers of the implementation, the eyebrow is to achieve ten targets, ten points, two points bang Shi, fourteen points.
As long as we don't encounter any more major natural disasters, the 400 catty program can be completed in most counties and cities, and some of them will also be completed.
Can be accomplished, some will exceed. It is understood that, in these three - two king sale tools, outside the city, there are Kangle, Jinta County
May reach mu yield of four hundred pounds. That is, at present the most difficult Qin'an, Zhangchachuan, Qingshui and other counties in the province, as long as the mobilization of the masses, redouble their efforts to complete the program.
As long as the masses are mobilized and efforts are redoubled, it is still possible to complete the plan. In this way, we encourage them to struggle hard and take strong measures to complete the program.
We are encouraging them to struggle hard and take vigorous measures to complete the program. The Party has to make sure that the pigeons do not complete the 400 catties this year, but complete the 300 catties, 350 catties, and 300 catties.
If we finish the 300 catties, we will still be able to produce more than 300 catties, which is not a big deal.

What is very exciting is that the vast number of cadres and branded people in the three-twenty five counties and cities have been working for the past months to realize the plan of this genus.
Planning, by Tao plucked up the water conservancy, the water in the maintenance, accumulation of fertilizer and so on several climaxes, really into a winter, big and dry a spring, and do big Thames hard work.
We have done a lot of hard work and achieved remarkable results. Take to participate in the envy than the fifteen with, city to Yi. In 1957

significance and economic significance. This is not only because the four hundred pounds plan for these counties has been announced in the pseudo-provinces and principalities, but more importantly
This is not only because these counties and cities have already announced the 400 pounds program in the pseudo-provinces and principalities, but more importantly, these 320 counties and cities have realized the 400 pounds program, which will make "three years of yellow war change the appearance of Nonsu, six years of Hankud, realize the ten articles of agricultural migration.
The task of "ten articles of agricultural migration supervision" will be realized in advance, and the grain output of each province will reach an average of one kilogram per person this year, making the food situation richer.
This will make the food situation more affluent, and will make the dream of the autumn counting faction complete in front of our great victory to be shattered.
And all this is our most practical implementation of the General Line. Through these political and ideological programs, we will strengthen our hands
Through these political and ideological training programs, we will strengthen the war mentality of the ministries and the masses in committing food to the sky and sounding out the lights to the earth; we will overcome the negative mentality of waiting for the day to come and waiting for the day to come; we will break down superstitions; we will refuse to allow the majority of the ministries and the masses to be influenced by the general line.
Superstitions will be dispelled, and the wisdom and strength of the masses will be mobilized to work together for the realization of this goal.

Third, grasp the technological revolution and metaphysical revolution. Maple actively retraining and reforming the old agricultural only, old tools, Jiaoguang new agricultural tools,
New tools and tools are being used to realize the transportation of trucks and trucks in general. Through these, labor efficiency is improved, and wells are changed in the fields of farming, fertilizing, irrigation and so on,
Fertilizer application, irrigation and other aspects of the state of the continent. We should actively and rapidly realize biogasification, so that the public can widely use biogas for lighting,
The people will be able to use the biogas for lighting, for filtration, and for power, so as to save fuel and to add fertilizer. In this regard, the provincial party committee and the local material and

Mud. At the same time, we should grasp the campaigns of eliminating women's propaganda and eliminating the four old men, but hygiene, and we should grasp the popularization of science and technology to make the science and culture of the majority of peasants more and more popular.
The popularization of science and technology should be emphasized, so that the scientific and cultural culture of the peasants can be improved at the same time as the agricultural progress.

Fourth, the full development of the labor force, the rational use of labor. This year, the tasks of domestic production and capital construction are very large.
This year, the tasks of industrial production and capital construction are both very large, so we must effectively organize labor, rationalize the use of labor, tap all labor potential, and eliminate all kinds of wasted labor.
The phenomenon of wasting labor will be eliminated. The Maple General 10th Kikuat team will specialize in water conservancy and taro conservation, and other production teams will share the work and support each other appropriately.
The other production teams divided the work appropriately and supported each other. The rural areas should have fewer market days (preferably one in seven days), popularize the three-tu-ho, establish nurseries or child-care centers, and popularize the use of the "mad group," which is a group of children who work in the rural areas.
They should promote the establishment of nurseries or child care centers, and promote the use of "mad bar" groups, laundry groups, "Riksan" and simple canteens to liberate and control women's labor potential.
This was done to liberate and control women's labor potential and to utilize the labor force of the elderly and Portuguese-speaking people. Since the summer harvest and replanting on a large scale began in some areas, agricultural work has become particularly difficult.
