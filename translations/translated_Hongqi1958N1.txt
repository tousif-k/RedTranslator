The people of this city also deeply realized that it was not a good idea to have disaster relief every year. They started with disaster relief and disaster prevention.
Rarely did they realize that raising more pigs was a good way to prevent disasters, and the central government was willing to do so.
The branch and the management committee insisted on mobilizing the members to raise more pigs.
But this community has been suffering from disasters for many years. However, this society has been affected by disasters for many years, and people do not have enough food to eat.
But the community had been suffering from disasters for many years, and the people did not have enough food to eat, so they did not raise pigs. In the middle of 1951, the community was able to raise more pigs.
Two hundred and four families fed more than thirty pigs, releasing a long time and mobilizing.
The community was mobilized, but the motivation to raise pigs was still low. What's the

There are gills to buy but no warmth, so the development of pig raising is not fast. The society and the management committee are concerned about this situation.
The government and the management committee have conducted a separate study on this situation.

They realized that there would be no great development of individual pig raising, so they decided to raise "socialist pigs" in the second cooperative.
It was decided that the second cooperative would raise "socialist pigs". Here

After the wheat harvest, the members of the community were all divided up and baked.
In order to prevent wastage, the poor paper mobilized the members to put the remaining grain of 7,500 yuan into the market.
The money could be used to buy pigs. This money could be used to buy pigs. Under the principle of public-private
the principle of public-private partnership, interest was paid at the credit rate, which solved the difficulty of buying pigs.
The difficulty of buying hogs has been solved. The problem of the gills was solved, and then there was the

The number of hogs quickly grew to 500,000. This was the first time that we were able to do this.
This has not only developed the collective release, but also increased the income of the group by more than 1,000 yuan, and greatly improved the quality of the work.
The income was more than one thousand dollars, but also the members' motivation to work for pigs was greatly developed.

The second method is based on the previous method, which is to classify the laborers and advance them. According to the number of laborers, the members were divided into three types.
The members of the community were divided into three types. The non-difficulty households were paid 30 cents per laborer, the average households 50 cents per laborer.
The general households were given 50 cents per labor, and the less labor-intensive and more populous households were given 70 cents per labor.
The average household is paid 50 cents per labor, and the small and populous ten thousand households are paid 70 cents per labor. Difficult households and "five guarantees" households receive a large portion of their own labor in addition to their own.
and the "five guarantees" households, except for their own labor, received a large portion, and the shortfall was taken care of by the article. This method
was implemented for a period of time and problems arose, namely, that the boundaries of various types of households were not easily demarcated.
The problem was that it was not easy to delineate the boundaries between the various types of households, and the fees for similar types of households were different.
Some of them have different standards, some of them do not drive, and some of them have a standard.
However, the problem is still not solved: because of the improper delineation of the boundaries of similar households, the people have no choice but to pay the fees.
The people are interested in this problem because of the inappropriate demarcation of similar households. Let the branches and committees
Let the branch and the committee study and improve the situation. In order not to waste money and to solve
the problem, they changed the method to one based on the actual needs of each household and the number of days of labor they could do.

In other words, on the basis of the production schedule, advance payment targets were set for households that needed to be penetrated, and for those that could not complete the fixed number of workdays due to objective reasons.
For those households that could not complete the fixed number of labor days for objective reasons, advances were still made on the basis of the number of days of living.
For those who, for objective reasons, cannot fulfill their work quotas, advances are made on the basis of the number of days of subsistence.

For essential expenses (schooling, SS.

Sickness, marriage, childbirth, etc.) were temporarily settled. In this way, the medical problems of the entire community of 200 temples and four villages were solved.

In this way, the medical problems of the entire community of 240 villages were solved, and the expenses of the community could be saved. The escape certificate shows that.

This method was better than the two previous methods. But it is still

In terms of the timing of advances, it will start with one advance per month.

Yugoslav revisionism
is a product of the policy of statism
Chen Boda

The struggle between the national Marxist-Leninist political parties and the revisionism of the Yugoslav leadership headed by Tito is a major international issue of late.
This is the most recent international scandal. Tito was the main instigator of this fight. In his own proposals, he has made little mention of Marxism-Leninism or of the ideology of the
In his own proposals, he attacked Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet Union as a whole, thinking that this would lead to a breakthrough in the development of a new form of Marxism-Leninism and a new form of socialism.
Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet Union as the communist camp were attacked in the belief that this would lead to the destruction of the Leninist position and the creation of an international communist movement. The Marxist-Leninists have had to rise to this challenge, and have begun to do so.
The Marxist-Leninists have had to rise to this challenge, and have already begun to make a bloody mess of it. Contrary to the Gento Group's original intentions, in this

Shield.

The revisionism of the Chinto group is not a product of the modern class struggle, it is a product of the policies of the modern state leaders, especially of the most evil of the world's people.
It is a product of the policies of the modern state sovereignty, especially of the world people's most evil American vice-industrialists.

The First International, with its regional information, was a reaction to the policy of the Communist Party of China.
The policy of the Communist Party of China. The modern correctionalism or neo-revisionism represented by Tito is different in its role from that of Berstein's
Wo correctionalism. Bernstein's WoCorrectivism emerged in the late nineteenth century, when imperialism was still a common world
At that time, imperialism was still a complete system in the world, and the dictatorship of the proletariat did not yet exist in the world. But we are now in the same time and place.
What kind of a time? It is a time when the proletarian revolution has reached us with a population of more than 100 million people, when socialism has taken shape as a new world system, and when the colonialist system has taken shape as a new world system.
A great new era in which the proletarian revolution is gaining ground with over 100 million people, in which socialism as a new world system has taken shape, in which colonialism has been solved and is being solved, in which the imperialist system is being attacked.
It is the great new era that Comrade MAO Falls East has described as "the East Gang overpowering the West Gang". It is the great new era of Comrade Mao Dong's "the East overpowers the West". In such a new era, the imperialist system
In such a new era, the struggle between the capitalist system and the capitalist system, and the struggle between the proletariat and the proletariat in various countries have become a fierce struggle between you and me, and the struggle for medicine has become a fierce struggle between you and me.
medicine and medicine have become a fierce battle, which will inevitably bring a new brand and a new color to modern revisionism, i.e., neo-revisionism.
The new revisionism will certainly bring a new brand and a new color to modern revisionism.  The new revisionism is a new color.

When Marx and the Tax Dodgers were still alive, they pointed out many times that the British proletariat had taken a small portion of the oil profits from the offing.

| The British proletariat had taken a small part of the oil from Guantanamo.
The British proletariat took a small portion of the offshore oil to support a group of workers. Engels once owed Marx a letter to change: "The worst of the British Federation of Trade Unions, they are willingly
They are guided by those who are bought by the proletariat or at least remunerated by the proletariat". As we all know, Lenzhu's work against revisionism, syncretism
As you know, in his fierce struggle against revisionism, syncretism, reformism, monastic chauvinism or syncretistic imperialism, he repeatedly pointed out that Mark and Engels were not the only ones who had been able to fight for the cause.
Lenin repeatedly pointed out this approach of Mark and Engels and put forward a new approach. Lenin writes, "Opportunism is objectively
is a class among the proletariat and the working class which has been bribed by imperialism with extra profits to turn itself into a doormat of capitalism and a destroyer of the workers' movement," Lenin wrote.
and the workers' movement.                                   The opportunists," wrote Nin.

What is the situation now? Since the working class has already gained power in one of the listed countries, the imperialists feel that it is not enough to buy off their own country's workers.
They feel that it is no longer enough to buy off the working class toppers in their own countries. In addition to this policy in their own countries, they are also buying up the working class in their own countries.
In addition to this policy in their own countries, the nationalists led by the U.S.A. are trying to find a way to establish their own socialist organizations in the socialist countries.

The US imperialist government is trying to break up the communist movement in some socialist countries, and to create a new system of association between the communist movement and the socialist countries. In this way, the American imperialists
The U.S. imperialists, having recognized the Yugoslavian leadership, adopted a policy of buying them out at a high price.

According to the materials of the American and Slavic press, the American financial assistance to the Yugoslav leadership groups lasted from the beginning of the first decade to the end of the second half of the 19th century.
According to the materials in the American and Slavic press, the United States' assistance to Yugoslavia, which started in the first half of 1952, amounted to more than 1.7 billion dollars by 1957, of which more than 1 billion dollars were transferred to the United States after 1945.
Of this amount, more than one billion dollars had been transferred to Pakistan since 1944. In addition, the Associated Press reported that from 1950 to 1957, the U.S. military aid to Yugoslavia amounted to one billion dollars.
In addition, the United States reported that from 1950 to 1957, the U.S. gave Yugoslavia more than one billion dollars in military aid. In addition, U.S. military aid to other countries was estimated at $300 million.
Taking all these figures together, the assistance of the entire capitalist world, headed by the United States, to Yugoslavia, amounted to about three billion dollars.
Around three billion dollars.

The report of the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the Republic of Yugoslavia (CPR), in its third report, states that half a percent of the national income of Yugoslavia has been spent on the development of the country's economy. Out of
It can be estimated that the U.S. aid has a significant share in the Yugoslav state budget, sometimes amounting to about one percent.

This is an obvious fact; the Yugoslav leadership, headed by Tito, not only feeds its own people, but also the US government, which has a large base in Yugoslavia.
It also feeds the U.S. government, which is based on a large base. In addition to this, the "American way of life", which the American nationalists are so proud of, has also been recognized as a major factor in the development of Yugoslavia.
In addition to this, the "American way of life", which the American nationalists are so vocal about, has also been introduced into Yugoslavia's social life by the American authorization, with the aim of trying to license the Yugoslav people.

According to the Washtenberg newspaper, on May 5, 2012, the American way of life was also introduced into the Yugoslavian life. According to the Washington Post, "The Republican Senate of Pittsburgh, which had previously been vigorously opposed to the U.S. policy toward Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia, is now in the process of organizing its own election.
The installment plan for the purchase of American electrical appliances, set up by Republican Senator Joyce Fowle, who had previously been a vocal opponent of U.S. policy toward Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia, is turning Yugoslavs from communists.

The presence of people determines their intentions. It's not the other way around, it's the massive amount of American aid shaming the "American way of life" that's causing the Slavic backlash.
It was the mass influx of American aid to the American way of life that caused changes in the intentions of the Slavic backward groups and the formation of a set of revisionist ideas of the Yugoslav leaders.

It was the change in the ideology of the Slavic backing groups that led to the formation of a revisionist system of thought in Yugoslavia, which determined the internal and external policies of the Yugoslav Legion that were anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-socialist, and anti-socialist.
The Yugoslav Youth League's anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-socialist camp and anti-socialist internal and external policies.

What were the main things?                                       -What was the main thing?

Firstly, on the question of the world political situation, Tito's group held a position which was fundamentally opposite to that declared by the Moscow Conference of the Communist and Labor Parties of the Socialist countries.
They denied that the most important feature of the modern world situation was the confrontation of two different world political systems and the confrontation of the world's political and economic systems with the world's political and economic system.
They denied that the modern world situation was characterized by the confrontation of two different socio-political systems of the world, and by the confrontation of two camps formed by two different socio-political systems.
The most important feature of the modern world situation is the confrontation between two different world socio-political systems and two camps formed by the two different socio-political systems.
They have completely mixed up socialism and socialism. They have completely blurred the distinction between the two fundamentally different social systems of socialism and Chabonism, and have confused the socialist camp with the imperialist camp.
They have completely blurred the distinction between the two fundamentally different socialist and Chabonist systems of society, and fused the two fundamentally different world political and economic systems, namely the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, into "a world divided into two opposing military and political blocs
The world is divided into two rival military and political blocs*, and there are sessions of "the consequences of the division of the world into two rival military and political blocs and the consequences of the division of the world economy into two rival military and political blocs".
 From the sophistry of the human-monkey-trust group
It is as if the world or the world economy was originally harmonized under the control of imperialism and imperialism; as if the
It is as if the capitalist countries have never branched out into a world monopoly of power based on the idea of monopolizing the highest profits, nor have they taken over the role of reorganizing the world.
Neither have they ever engaged in a world war for the redivision of the world, nor have they ever engaged in a world war for the redivision of the world. The Hinto Group is of the opinion that the way out for mankind
The Hinto Group believes that the way out for mankind is not to replace the socialist system with the Tambonist system. Their program is that the U.S. imperialism can be manipulated by the U.S. imperialism and the building of the United Nations.
United Nations, "to promote and facilitate the pseudo-face cooperation and mutual proximity of all peoples, that is, to make the world more and more
to bring the world closer together".

What kind of "garlic" is it to hope that the United Nations, which the U.S. wants to organize, will promote the unity of the world? What kind of "garlic" is this?
Is this not Tito's yearning for the "unity" of the world, which the American imperialists are trying to rule?

Secondly, the Tito group declared that they did not belong to the socialist camp. The position of the "super-group".
The position of the "supergroup".

What is the meaning of this nonsense? It has been proved that (1) they are outside the socialist camp headed by the USSR and the international proletariat, but only in the form of a reactionary group.
They are outside the ranks of the Soviet Union and the international proletariat, and are merely substituting reactionary proletarian nationalism for revolutionary proletarian internationalism.

Issue 1, No. 3.

The first issue of 3, | | | | | |
(2) The "supra-group" standpoint of the individual is nothing else but a standpoint which is suited to the needs of the imperialist bloc.
The "supergroup" position of others is nothing but putting themselves in a position suitable for the needs of the imperialist bloc.

Thirdly, on the question of war and peace, it has always been the view of the kinematics that modern war is rooted in the ideology of annihilation, that is, nationalism, and that the socialist countries are not the only ones to be affected.
The root cause of modern warfare is nationalism, and socialist countries and national communist parties are the core force for the preservation of world peace. However, the
The Zento Group, however, directed its attacks against the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, while defending the warlike politics of the imperialist camp.
money as an apologist for the imperialist camp's warlike politics. This is what Tito said: "As a result of Stalin's threatening foreign policy of two lines of carbon and no machine, the Western Powers see that there is no need for the Soviet Union to be a threat to the Soviet Union.
As a result of Stalin's threatening foreign policy, the Western Powers saw that it was impossible to achieve their own goals through diplomacy, and concluded that only a show of strength could achieve their own goals.
They concluded that the only way to achieve their goals was to show their strength. This was the basic reason for the signing of the North Atlantic Peace Agreement and the establishment of the Military Jiao Tong." (Utopian Gento's Report on the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the South).
Tito's group is obviously trying to make the most reactionary statement that the root cause of the threat is not the US-led imperialist system and the US-led military organization.
The root cause of the threat is not the imperialist system led by the United States and the Greek network, but the communist system led by the Free Trade Union and the bamboo association.
It is not the imperialist system and the Greek system, led by the United States, that is the root cause of such threats.

First, according to Lenin)
The era of the proletarian revolution. Although the proletarian revolution has been paralyzed by a series of national victories since the October Revolution, Zaibatsu nationalism has not been able to win.
Although the proletarian revolution has been victorious in a number of countries since the October Revolution, the era of proletarian revolution has not yet passed, as the final fall of Jaegerism has yet to take place. The era of proletarian revolution is not over.
According to the Zento Group, the world has now skipped the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, because "the typical Reinbenist
The typical Reinbublican system has definitely become a thing of the past", and socialism is now being realized in all Chabonist countries. In this way, Tito's group repeatedly
Tito's group repeated the following words of the "era": "Mankind is in the process of realizing socialism". The Tito group repeatedly used the following words to describe the "era": "Mankind is moving inexorably through various paths into the age of socialism, into a new era of socialism, and into a new era of socialism.
"Humanity is moving inexorably, through various paths, into the age of socialism, into an age in which socialism is becoming the content and the method of the permanent practice of both human beings". "Humanity
lives today, above all, in the era of the implementation and consolidation of new forms of initiation, politics and regionalization based on socialist economic relations."
epoch of itemization." From this, they arrived at the brand: socialist thought no longer primarily surrounds the old, blame-based system of socialism.
The socialist ideology is no longer mainly centered on the old system of socialism. That is to say, there is no question of destroying the Chabonist system in all countries of the world.
The proletariat's philosophy has become "obsolete", and it is only a help to the "dogmatists" of the world.
This is only the help of the "countrified" people of the Frontier.

Fifthly, according to Lenin, the capitalist system "spreads everywhere the tendency to rule rather than to be free. This
The result of this tendency to rule is an open reaction in all political and legal systems". And according to the Gento Group
The Jaunto Group considers the capitalism of the poor to be "socialism". In the Chabonist state, they say, "the state supervises the capital and partially restricts private management.
capital, partially restricting the right of private management of selenocapitalist property, and taking away some of the exclusive functions of private ownership in the economy and in society.
and in society". "The government has lost its complete independence in some of the sectors which it administers, and some of them have lost their independence.
In some sectors of the economy, the State is losing its independence, and some of its functions are being transferred to an increasing extent to the State." "The State has taken over the management of the economy.

of the state, and is practicing the task of taking away the old dysentery.          -It's not for the sake of the state.

Therefore, Tito's group believed that in a capitalist state, the workers did not need to break up the proletariat's apparatus, they could just remember that the workers were the ones who were in charge of the state apparatus, and that they were the ones who were in charge of the state apparatus.
It was therefore believed by Tito's group that in the capitalist countries the workers did not need to break the apparatus of the proletariat in order to "turn the apparatus of the state into the public apparatus of the union". There, the task of the workers is only to
"to gain a decisive influence on politics and to ensure the gradual development of socialism in accordance with their political power.

Tito's group, which had proved to reward the dictatorship of the proletariat, was of course also keen to neutralize the dictatorship of the proletariat. Like
Like the reactionaries of the First Trade Movement, they are convinced that the dictatorship of the proletariat is inevitably a "rich-universalist" and "official-universalist state-royalist".
....                                           ...

Eighthly, the Axialists argue that there are two forms of socialist ownership, ǫ-citizen ownership and collective ownership, while citizen-ownership is socialist ownership.
Citizen-ownership was the most important form of socialist ownership. However, the Zento group made the citizen-ownership system of socialist countries, i.e. state ownership, a form of socialist ownership.
However, the Janto group labeled civic ownership in socialist countries, i.e. state ownership, as "state chauvinism", as "the final reflection of the intervening relations". But the truth is that there are only two types of ownership in a socialist economy.
However, there are only two systems of ownership in the socialist economy, namely the "collective ownership" and the "individual ownership". and "individual ownership". *The "collective ownership" and the "individual ownership". What he means by "collective" ownership is that the direct producers of minerals are the ones who own the mines.
Collective ownership, as he called it, meant that the direct producers of minerals "decide for themselves on the production and total distribution of the product in question". They argued that "each
They argued that "landed property" was also "an integral part of the large-scale socialist agrarian commons" and that small private owners were also "part of the large-scale socialist agrarian commons". They argued that "all landed property" was also "an integral part of the large socialist agrarian commons", and that "small private owners are also "an integral part of the forces of the socialist krauts".
The small private owner is also "an integral part of the power of the socialist kleptocracy".                    -The small proprietor is also "an integral part of the forces of rapist Kremlin".

5 The state capitalism of the past is to be "syncretistic", to be "socialist", to be "socialist", to be "socialist", to be "socialist", to be "socialist".
The socialist system of ownership for all is the state's "unrighteousness", while the former is what they make of it, and the latter is what they reject.

The collective is superior to the citizen, and the individual is superior to the collective. Their
Their slogan is: "Congregationalism does not subordinate the whole man to any 'supreme being'".  Their message is: "The interests of the individual can be placed above the interests of the collective and the citizen.
The individual's interests can be placed above the collective and civic interests, not the individual's interests should be subordinated to the collective and civic interests; the collective's interests, moreover, should be subordinated to the collective's interests.
The collective interest can be placed above the interest of the citizen, rather than the collective interest being subject to the interest of the citizen, and the collective interest being subject to the interest of the citizen.
The collective interest, on the other hand, can be placed above the interest of the citizens, instead of the collective interest being subject to the interest of the citizens.

Tito's "unionism", however quaint it may be, is actually meant to be a form of "membershipism". It is, in fact, the "totalism" of the proletariat, the "totalism" of the imperialists, the "totalism" of the imperialists.
It is the "socialism" of the imperialists, which, when compared with the socialism of Marxism-Leninism and the socialism realized in the socialist countries, is a far cry from the socialism of Marxism-Leninism and the socialism realized in the socialist countries.
Compared with the socialism of Marxism-Leninism and the socialism realized by the socialist countries, it is simply another matter. Therefore, of course, they simply deny the common law of socialist revolution and socialism.
Therefore, of course, they fundamentally reject the common laws of socialist revolution and socialism, and oppose the common ideology and concerted action of the international proletarian and communist movements, and put this common ideology and concerted action in malice.
They oppose the common ideology and concerted action of the international proletarian and communist movements, and maliciously and uniformly label this common ideology and concerted action as "ideological arbitrariness" and "political hegemony". and "political hegemony".

Tenthly, from the above point of view, the Zento Group is hostile to the communist parties of all countries. They are in harmony. "The indignation is that communist parties can

to break into every form of the unionist movement, swabbing the idea that socialism can only be realized in these parties, yea only through them, is theoretically incorrect and in practice very harmful.
The notion that socialism can be manifested only in these parties, yea only through them, is theoretically incorrect and very harmful in practice." Also County, "The base Communist
The basic communist parties ...... have ceased to be revolutionary, creative agents for social development in their own countries."

The Tito group despised the Communist Party of the United States. But as history will eventually show, the American Communist Party, small as it is now, has the power to make a difference.
The American Communist Party, small as it is now, has a vitality and a great future, while the Junto Group, which now governs Yugoslavia with respect, can only guarantee that their feet will not be turned away from Yugoslavia.
But they can guarantee that their feet won't be tipped over by their own revisionism.

Eleventh, Tito's group described the "International Workers' Congress as having failed to keep pace with the development of social and material conditions in the last decade".
"In the late Stalinist period, the international workers' congress failed to keep pace with the development of social and material conditions". "In the late Stalinist period, the workers' movement in Haumea not only ceased, but also regressed."

In the eyes of the Tito clique, the victory of the Great October Revolution and the success of the Soviet Union are invisible.
The Tito clique is blind to the victory of the Great October Revolution and the success of the Soviet Union, to the great victory in the anti-fascist war, to the existence of new
We cannot see the existence of new capitalist countries and the development of the workers' movement in the last capitalist countries, nor can we see the great Chinese revolution and the People's Republic of China.
The great Chinese revolution and the People's Republic of China.

.... Eleventh, Tito said, "In the last ten years, Marxist thought has lagged behind the development of modern society".
As the People's Daily pointed out, the Chintos summarized the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory as "several articles".
The Chinto group presented the basic principles of revolutionary Marxist-Leninist theory as "dogmatism", and they called themselves "the irreconcilable masters of dogmatism".
How is it possible for them to understand the question of the development or non-development of Marxism? How could they possibly be concerned about the development or non-development of Marxism?
They are not aware of the great developments that have taken place under the guidance of the Communist Party since the October Revolution, and they are opposed to the "dogmatism" and the "pragmatism" of Marxism.
The Communist Party of China (CPC) has also been a leader of the CPC in the past few years. In the meantime, they have been talking about "human nature", "human individuality", "individual freedom", "human beings as fearful creatures", "the richness of human nature", and "the human spirit".
How is it possible to find a common attack with Marxism-Leninism when we are talking about "human nature", "human personality", "individual freedom", "human spirituality", "human beings as creatures of fear" and so on?
How is it possible to find a common attack with Marxism-Leninism?

The eleven points listed above include the pseudo-partial orthodox views of the Tito group and their internal and external policies.
But these points alone are enough to show how Tito's revisionism serves the imperialists, especially the American imperialists.
especially the American imperialists.

In his report to the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the South, Bauto referred to de Geras as a revisionist. Bauto said that "according to the outside world
and for the sake of the Judaizers, these people have written Yugoslavian pamphlets of the same kind as the realities.
water pamphlets." However, the West German "Allgemeine Zeitung", in an article of April 21, puts it very well: "Here, too, this incident is not much more than a cold one.
"Here, too, the incident is not much more than a cold snarl. For the basic idea of this flare-up was put into practice a few years ago in the prison of DeGerasse, where he is today.
The basic idea of this fire was started a few years ago by De Geras, who is in prison today." Of course, there is a certain difference between de Geras and the Trotskyist group, and that difference is that de Geras was a Marxist-Leninist.
The difference is that Dzheeras has not even put on the Marxist-Leninist garb, while the Kuto group is still more interested in Marxism-Leninism as a pretext.
But did it ever occur to Mentor that the contents of the Southern Communist Party were in fact a reprint of the pamphlet "The New Order" by de Geras?

| The new order of the Communist Party of China (CPJC) was a reprint of the pamphlet
The best thing is for Tito to pick up De Geras's booklet "The New Order". Better Tito take up the drink of de Gerace to limit himself.

The people of Yugoslavia, after the success of the anti-fascist movement, began to follow the path of syncretism. However, under Tito's policy
However, under the domination of Tito's policy, Yugoslavia has not been able to fight on the road of conferenceism, not only in the paper war, but also in the political and ideological worlds,
Yugoslavia has not yet solved the problems of the internal struggle against the two paths. In the countryside there, the individual
In the countryside there, the individual economy still accounts for more than 90 percent of the population, which is a good way to save the glass for the resurgence of capitalism.

The problem of ownership in Yugoslavia cannot be solved alone. The more serious problem for the Yugoslav people is that the U.S. imperialists are not able to realize that the U.S. is not the only country in the world.
The more serious problem for the people of Yugoslavia is that the dollar policy of US imperialism is playing a role in the leadership of the bloc, which has put the people of Yugoslavia on the path of direct unionism.
the path of direct unionism.

The dollar policy of U.S. imperialism towards Yugoslavia began in 1945, as shown in the materials of the previous parties. Before
Before 1945, the Chinto bloc had already begun to depart from the orbit of proletarian internationalism and to form a reactionary bourgeois-nationalism, which was the same as that of the U.S. imperialists.

this.         .
Although the Jugoslav Communist Party has moved to call *individual ownership? and "private land production? and "private land production" are also "socialism". but it is understandable that the Southern Communist Party leadership does not necessarily want to, and cannot
It is understandable that the Southern Communist Party's two guiding groups do not necessarily want to, and cannot, abolish all at once some form of public ownership that has been realized in the past.
It is understandable, however, that the Southern Communist Party leadership does not necessarily want to, and cannot, abolish all at once some form of public ownership that has been realized in the past. If they did, they would not only jeopardize the interests of the Yugoslav working class and other conscious working people, but they would also be in danger of losing the Yugoslavia.
If this were to happen, not only would the Yugoslav working class and other conscious working people lose their trust, but the Yugoslav leadership would also lose its political credentials as an advocate for its own people and as a disruptive force in the international arena.
It would also lose its political credentials to bargain with the US imperialists.

The mothballing policy of the Jugoslavian people and the communists of the Yugoslav Party who are loyal to the Jagdpanist Party are on the path of conservatism, and the Central Powers will not be able to realize their goal.
The policy of the Zeto group was a contradiction in terms. Therefore, the Hutto group was happy to preserve some form of communalism in order to preserve its own support.
The Hutto Group is therefore happy to preserve some form of communalism in order to preserve its own support. As long as the Hutto Group is aware of the hostility of the international communist movement and accepts the USSR as the common denominator, the U.S. imperialists will not be able to take any action against the Hutto Group.
The U.S. imperialists also agreed to the preservation of certain forms of public ownership in Yugoslavia, as long as the Chinto bloc was aware that it was hostile to the international communist movement and accepted the Soviet Union as a universal communist camp.
The U.S. imperialists also agreed to the preservation of certain forms of public ownership in Yugoslavia and adopted a "non-interventionist" attitude. For example, on November 9, 15,000, the "American News and Attack" wrote.
"In the tax-heavy world of the Soviet Union, it is now the socialist countries outside the USSR that are being taxed," he said.
The Eisenhower administration has moved to support Titoism.
The Eisenhower administration supported Titoism." In a press conference on the role of Yugoslavia last year, Mr. Szigetz said, "We've got a lot to learn about Yugoslavia, and we've got a lot to learn about it.
It is possible to have a communist regime that is not controlled by our 'international communism' or Soviet-style communism.
It is possible to have a communist regime that is not controlled by our 'international communism' or Soviet-style communism.

In the view of the Marxists, in societies governed by a number of classes of people, it is possible for a communist regime to be established without being dominated by us or by an international communist regime or by a Soviet-style communist regime.
In the view of the Marxists, in some societies ruled by a class of people, it is not a bad thing to allow some form of "public ownership" as long as it harms or even favors the fundamental interests of the class. It is not surprising that some form of "public ownership" is permitted, as long as it harms or even favors the fundamental interests of that class. For example.

In a feudal society, the preservation of some kind of village commune, some kind of communal ownership, or some form of self-government, is shed when the Pushchow
In a feudal society, the preservation of a village commune, a form of communal ownership or a form of self-government is a matter of common sense. In a capitalist society, the joint-stock company can also be a form of "public ownership" for the capitalists.
In a capitalist society, a joint stock company can also be a form of "public ownership" for the capitalist. However, as we all know, that form of ownership does not hinder, but rather ensures that the Chabon family gets the highest level of ownership.
The Chabon family was guaranteed the highest profits. After the October Revolution, the counter-revolutionaries wanted to make use of the soviets.
After the October Revolution, counter-revolutionaries tried to use the soviets as a means of "supporting the soviets with the participation of non-producers"; after the collectivization of agriculture in the USSR, some counter-revolutionaries also tried to use the soviets as a means of "supporting the soviets".
After the collectivization of agriculture in the USSR, some counter-revolutionaries also wanted to make use of the collective farms as a form of "collective security without the participation of members of the proletariat".
The Soviet Union was collectivized in the form of collective farms. Stalin was right in saying that "everything depends on what the form contains".
The form of rent bondage is not political, it is not political, it is not political, it is only a crude form, but the question is where it is held, where it is not guided.
The question is, where is it held, where is it guided?

As Mao Zedong said in his "Questions on the Proper Handling of Internal Contradictions among the People", the revisionists also pay lip service to the idea that the people's internal contradictions are not a matter of politics, but of the people's internal contradictions, and that they are not a matter of politics.
Revisionists also pay lip service to Marxism. In Yugoslavia, the Hutto group allowed people to hang up pictures of Marx and Lenin.
In Yugoslavia, the Hutu group also allowed people to put up pictures of Marx and Lenin. The nature of the problem is similar to that of the previous question. What the Tito group did was to keep the Kremlin's rhetoric tightly in place.
The Tito group's approach was to preserve the rhetoric of Kepiism and to cut out its revolutionary content. In countries where the workers' movement has a Marxist message, revisionists, opportunists
The opportunists, the opportunists, can accept certain parts of the doctrine in accordance with the interests of the proletariat, even if this is the case.
Even this is a kind of class struggle. Lenin said: "If one accepts only class struggle, one is not a fundamentalist, one has not left the proletarian class, and one has not left the proletarian class.
He is also a person who has not left the sphere of proletarian ideology and proletarian policy. To limit the paralyzing influence of Marxism by means of class struggle is to sever the ties of Marxism.
To restrict paralyticism by means of class struggle is to split up paralyticism, to explain away paralyticism, and to make it acceptable to the proletariat. Only by
those who extend the mad class struggle to the dictatorship of the proletariat in general are the Marxist-phoenixist tide." However, the opportunism of the same

needs, they obliterated the class struggle as well.

The SCAP claims that under no circumstances can they change their revisionist position, and that any "change of position" that is attributed to them is not acceptable to the US imperialists.
Any "attempt" to make them change their position is an "illusion" and "futile". and "futile". At the same time, they claim that they cannot
At the same time, they also claimed that they could not "cease their practice", that is to say, they could even move towards Marxism-Leninism. From this we can see that the C.C.C.
This is possible. Is this fight good for Marxism-Leninism? Comrade Mao Tse-tung said that, under certain conditions.
Comrade Mao Zedong said that under certain conditions, "saving can be turned into a good thing". Things always develop according to the dialectic. The Communist Party of China (CPC) has centralized the modern revisionist ideology.
The concentration of the modern revisionist ideology in Yugoslavia will also educate the people of Yugoslavia and international communism in the opposite direction, and will enable people to further recognize what is Zenk and what is not.
This will make it possible to recognize further what is Kristian-Leninism and what is anti-Kristian-Leninism. The Togolese Leninists
An unequivocal and unambiguous fight against revisionism will certainly bring the international communist movement a good start.
The international communist movement is in a good position to do so.

| The year 1958.
Half a day

One of the basic features of our time was the existence of two fundamentally opposed economic systems in the world.
On the one hand, there is socialism, which is developing, and on the other hand, there is imperialism, which is declining and giving way. At present, just as the USSR, China and other countries of the socialist camp are in the midst of the
At present, while the USSR, China and other countries in the socialist camp are making great leaps forward in production, China, as the first six countries in the imperialist camp, is experiencing a deep economic crisis.
The economic crisis is deep and devastating. This once again demonstrated to the whole world that the system of imperialism was in a state of abject failure.
It also demonstrated the superiority of the club system.4 Now the economic crisis in the United States is hitting the whole subnationalist world.
The US crisis is now hitting the entire subaltern world. This is the beginning of a different economic opportunity for the world of capitalism on the basis of a widening of the general crisis of capitalism.
This is the beginning. The development of the crisis will definitely further intensify the contradictions in the imperialist sector, and will lead the national liberation movements of the colonized countries and the colonialist countries to a more radical development.
The national liberation movements in the colonial countries will be intensified, and the consciousness of the working class and the masses in the capitalist countries will be raised to a higher level of enlightenment, and the revolutionary struggle will be intensified.
The working class and the masses of the people in the capitalist countries have become more conscious and the revolutionary struggle has developed even more. This was an important event that moved the whole world of capitalism, and it was a further
It is a new sign of the overthrow of the West and will have a great influence on the development of the situation in the future.

Next

The crisis in the United States is a cyclical overproduction crisis. The crisis is first and foremost a crisis of overproduction.
It began with a sharp decline in industrial production. In December, 1955, industrial production in the USA reached its highest level since the beginning of the crisis.
In December 1955, it reached its highest level since its inception, with an index of 47 (100 for the period 1971-1949). Compared with this peak, the index of production in
Compared with this peak, the index of production in March of this year had already fallen to 122, i.e., by a further 13 percent. And the magnitude of this decline
This decline is much more drastic than the two post-war crises in the U.S. in the years 14,000-1,119 and 1,533-1,914, respectively.
The first quarter of this year has been a hu-ming. In the first quarter of this year, production fell sharply, affecting all industrial sectors, and the most serious decline was in the industrial drug base.
The most serious decline was in the heavy industry, which is the foundation of the industry. Comparing the first quarter of this year with the first quarter of last year, production fell by 10.5 percent.
production fell by 10.5 percent (the start of the iron industry averaged 54 percent in the first quarter of last year, but fell to 16 percent in the second quarter of last year).
Double fell to the Philosopher's 16th), coal production Yan decreased by 21 percent, oil production decreased by 12 percent, and
The silicon production of automobiles decreased by 32-1 days, and the production of lathes decreased by one-third. The production of lathes was reduced by one-third.
Certain industries which have been in a state of confusion for many years, such as the Republican industry, fell by 11.0 percent in February this year compared with December 1956, and the Yogurt industry fell by 11.0 percent this year compared with December 2016.
The industry is down by 6.5 percent in February of this year compared with December of 1966, and the industry is down by 6.5 percent in March of last year, and so on.

Another important symptom of the crisis is the rapid increase in the number of lost seeds. According to the official figures published in the United States, the number of fully unemployed people is more than five at present.
According to the official figures released by the US, the number of totally unemployed people is more than 50 million, reaching the highest peak in 16 years. This is due to the fact that the U.S. authorities have put a lot of people out of work.

The first 19.

The number of unemployed workers in the United States is still much higher than the actual number of unemployed workers in the United States. The number of unemployed and underemployed workers in the United States is estimated to be over 10 million.
The number of unemployed and underemployed workers in the United States has exceeded 10 million, accounting for more than one-sixth of the total number of people employed in the United States. In addition, the average number of hours worked per
The average number of hours worked per job has dropped from 41 hours in December, 1972, to 333 hours in April of this year.
The average working hours per bureau have been reduced from 41 hours in December 1912 to 30.3 hours in April this year. Some of the supplementary income they used to earn from overtime work is now gone. And prices are still rising. Therefore, even
workers who have not yet lost their jobs, their inter-party labor rates are decreasing. According to official information, the actual workload of working people will be reduced by the end of this year.
According to the official data, the actual work rate of the workers in the industry has been lowered by 4.7 percent in the past year up to January this year. As in all crises, the Chabon family first
As in all crises, the Chabon family is first and foremost attacking the low standard of living of the working class. The growing army of unemployed in the U.S.
The growing army of unemployed in the United States is reminiscent of the situation in the 1930s. The United States recruited

Newspapers in the United States reported on the sadness of the working class and the fact that the number of unemployed people was still growing.
  and the number of unemployed people is still

The tragic situation has been widely reported. As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the livelihood of the working class is still being drastically deprived.

Agricultural production in the United States, on the other hand, has been in a state of surplus for a long time. Wheat seeding and accumulation, has increased from one to four to 11,000 tons.
The wheat seeding and volume has increased from 27DO square hectares in 1972 to 1.7OO square hectares in 157 years. 7OO square hectares, production from 3,-OOO million
metric tons to 11 DO million metric tons. Although the U.S. government has reduced the agricultural acreage and production, well and with the government axle
The government also used the government price to maintain the price of agricultural products. Purchase of agricultural products and to the outside world and other methods, but still can not coup the agricultural overproduction caused by the serious situation.
However, it still could not solve the serious situation caused by the overproduction of agriculture. Agricultural famine has become a constant part of the American capitalist economy in the long run.

All of these facts show that the U.S. is in a serious crisis. In the face of this fact.
There are various bourgeois and orthodox arguments about "people's capitalism", "capitalism can escape the crisis", "the crisis is not a problem", "the crisis is not a problem", "the crisis is not a problem", "the crisis is not a problem", "the crisis is not a problem".
The "fundamentalist" Marxist theory of crisis is outdated", "as a result of the accumulation and concentration of production, there is a greater risk of a crisis in the economy," and "as a result of the accumulation and concentration of production, there is a greater risk of a crisis in the economy.
As production builds up and is centralized, there is a greater likelihood that the planning factor will be incorporated into the delivery of goods and services within the framework of the crisis. All of this propaganda has been

All of this propaganda has been destroyed. The facts prove that the Marxist-Unionist statement in the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Balkanist countries.

The Civist assertion that "the subaltern economy is incapable of new, deep shocks and crises" is entirely correct.
Now, what the Haumea proletariat is waiting for is not whether there is a crisis or not (they are afraid of "retreat"), but how deep and wide the crisis will be, and how long it will last.
Now it is not a question of whether there is a crisis or not (they are afraid of a "Yuan retreat"), but of the depth and breadth of the crisis, how long it will last, and so on.

The crisis in the United States, like the crisis in Portugal, is a result of the intensification of the misalignment of the productive forces and relations of production in the capitalist economy, which has led to the emergence of a crisis in the United States.
The crisis in the United States is the result of the sharpening of the misalignment of the productive forces and relations of production. Specifically, the anarchy of production in the post-war period was aggravated under the dictatorship and the expansion of production.
The contradiction between the expansionist tendency of production and the limited development of the market has reached a certain level of crisis.
The degree of crisis has reached a certain level. From all points of view, the period of prosperity that the U.S. economy had enjoyed for several years had definitely come to an end. According to the law of development of the

| Now, Ri, the opposite of them, the factors that contributed to the crisis in Portugal.
Now, Ri their opposite, became the
the cause of the crisis and its development.

One of the major factors that supported the post-war prosperity of the United States was the arms race. Soon after the end of World War II, the U.S.
Soon after the end of the Second World War, the United States embarked on the expansion of its armaments and preparations for war. In the past thirteen years, the direct military expenditure of the United States amounted to three thousand nine hundred and sixty-six billion dollars.
Nowadays, the annual defense expenditure of the United States accounts for more than 14% of the national income. Undoubtedly, the militarization of the U.S. has played a great role in the development of the U.S. economy.
The militarization of the United States has played a great role in the development of the country's economy, but the consequences of this development are the unilateral expansion of production and the deformation of the development of productive forces. On the one hand
On the one hand, the heavy industry was expanding rapidly, but on the other hand, the production of daily necessities was in a state of collapse. Here is only an example of the production of mesh iron.
The development of steel production in the United States was the result of the development of steel production in the United States. The development of steel production in the United States was directly related to the war and war preparation. In the four years following World War I, American steel production increased.
In the four years following World War I, U.S. steel production grew by only two percent. After the Second World War, steel production in the United States increased from a long time
After the Second World War, its steel production increased from the long-stagnant level of 40 million tons to about 80 million tons, and after the Korean War, it failed to increase to about 100 million tons.
Increase to 100 million tons. The growth of the production capacity of the mesh bag brought a great disaster to the U.S. economy. The decline in U.S. production
The decline in U.S. production was most severe in the netting industry and in the next industrial sectors directly related to the NWT. At the same time, the increase in costs
The increase in the cost of military expenditures has added to the burden of the people. The average cost of military spending per person in the United States is 1929-19119, and the average cost of military spending per person in the United States is 1929-19119.

This greatly limited the purchasing power of the population, which in turn prevented the production of living materials from developing accordingly.
Producer material production. The outbreak of the US crisis has precisely illustrated this situation. Therefore, the expansion of armaments
On the contrary, it deepened the inner contradictions of the American economy and made the crisis even more serious.
The updating and expansion of the model was also a very important factor in the post-war prosperity of the United States. However, the expansion of production capacity was not accompanied by the expansion of consumption capacity.
However, in the production capacity expansion at the same time, the consumption capacity Han did not get the corresponding growth, the result caused the excess production capacity. According to the U.S.
According to the estimation of the American press, after the war, the production capacity of the United States increased by 8 percent per year, while the production volume increased by 3 percent per year.
Three, so the under-utilization has been the United States of America in the path of the common phenomenon. The start-up rate of enterprises was 92% at the end of May, 1959, and 92% at the end of May, 1959, of the total number of enterprises.
At the end of 1995, it was 92 percent, at the end of 1995, it was 10 percent, and in September of 1957, it was 11 percent.
In January of this year, it was down to 7%. In 1994 and 119, and again in 114, the start-up rate dropped to as low as 7%.
The minimum number of labor starts dropped to 11 percent. But the crisis started last September, and it's been down to 10 percent.
This is an indication of the crisis of overproduction in the United States. This shows the severity of the overproduction crisis in the United States. In the period of crisis, the profitability of the shoe industry started to decline.
The first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year. In the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period of last year, the total profit of the shoe industry declined by 3% - Wang. At the same time.
Stock prices are also falling. For example, the stocks of companies producing consumer goods in Australia have fallen by 11 percent in the last year.
Eleven percent. Related to all this is the rapid decline in fixed capital investment in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. fixed capital investment will be $5 billion less than in 1957, a decline of 13 percent.
Among them, the investment of non-ferrous gold bureau is reduced by 43%, such as iron industry and another 10 days, the automobile industry 18%, and the transportation industry 30%.
The automobile industry was 18 percent, and the transportation industry was 30 percent. According to the analysis of various aspects, now the United States due to the process of Qinben renewal has basically floor
The first 21.

In the 1930s, the US dollar was seven dollars, but in recent years, it has increased to about 150 dollars, which is more than 30 times the amount of the US dollar.  The United States of America is now in the process of updating the United States of America's fixed costs.

| The number of dollars has increased by more than 30 times in recent years.

This is the reason why the U.S. economy is in such a state of flux. This is one of the deeper roots of the U.S. crisis, which could be more severe and long-lasting.
This is a deep-rooted cause of a more severe and protracted crisis in the United States.

Another important factor that enabled the U.S. to increase industrial output after the war was the strengthening of the working class and the lowering of the level of health care for the underprivileged.
level of health care for the working class and lowering the level of health care for the immigrant population. In this respect, too, things have come to the opposite end of the spectrum. A decisive factor in the economic crisis of the United States was the
One of the decisive causes of the economic crisis in the United States has been the relative decline in the income of the working people, the decline in their purchasing power, the decline in the domestic market, the decline in the income of the working class and the decline in the level of health care.
and the purchasing power of the working people declined, and the domestic market was relatively small. On the one hand, the working people are subjected to the daily suffering of their own country, and on the other hand, they have to pay for the work of the proletarian state.
On the one hand, the working people have to bear a huge burden of donations for the late proletarian state. Nowadays, with the increase of unemployment and unemployment among the unemployed and the decrease of actual workers, the working people have to pay a huge amount of contributions to the end-productive state.
Now, with the increase of unemployment, unemployment in the middle and the decrease of actual workers, the income of the working people is declining rapidly. In March of this year, the total amount paid for work in the processing industry was down by a fraction of a percentage point from the amount paid in December of last year.
In March of this year, the total amount paid for work in the processing industry was 16 percent lower than in December of last year. In one year, the total amount paid to workers in the United States amounted to $15 billion. A
Farmers' incomes in the first quarter of 1957 were down by as much as one-third from the level of the previous year.

The expansion of the economy also contributed to the decline of the domestic market. Because the postwar expansion of the U.S. economy was initially out of step with the
Consumers old ability to pay does not match, so Moss Sibben took in addition to the purchase, installment payment and many other artificial means to seek to
Make consumers pay for future purchasing power in advance to maintain and stimulate demand in the domestic market. And the slight economic prosperity of the United States after becoming
prosperity, to a large extent, is built on this false and unqualified cause. By the end of the first quarter of this year, U.S. residents' debt had already reached the level of
At the end of the first quarter of this year, the debt of American residents had reached one thousand seven hundred and sixty billion dollars, accounting for more than one percent of their annual income. The debt is more than... Each year, U.S.
Consumers pay back $51 billion in principal and interest each year, which is roughly 17 percent of each person's after-tax income. Now, U.S.
Now, these artificial measures used by the American monopoly capital to stimulate production are not only becoming less and less effective, but have also caused the opposite effect.
The result is that the contradiction between production and the market is widening, and the crisis of overproduction is deepening day by day.

Not only the domestic market, diagnosis and foreign market demand for U.S. goods is also declining. February this year's U.S. exports
In February of this year, U.S. exports fell by less than one-third compared to March of last year, the highest month for U.S. exports. This is also of great significance
This is also of great significance. One of the most important factors contributing to the growth of U.S. production after the war was that the U.S. took advantage of the favorable situation in the post-war Chabonist world market to strengthen its production capacity.
The U.S. took advantage of the favorable situation in the post-war world market to strengthen its foreign expansion, and implemented a series of measures such as the "Verbena Demon Plan" and foreign "aid" to capture markets for itself.
The U.S. has taken a series of measures, such as the "Whirlwind Program" and "foreign aid", to capture sales markets and spheres of influence for itself. The share of the United States in the year 147 reached its peak, that is to say, it accounted for
The United States' share reached its peak in 147, accounting for 32.5 percent, but it has been declining greatly since then, and in recent years it has dropped to about 10 percent.
Now, not only Britain and France Now, not only Britain and France have regained the status of competing countries, but also West Germany and Japan have returned to the status of serious competing countries.
West Germany, Japan and other countries have reappeared in the world market as serious competitors. The competition in the world is more centralized than ever.
more centralized than ever. 
In the crisis, the U.S. could still take advantage of some favorable conditions in the world market to strengthen its foreign expansion and reduce the pressure of domestic overproduction to a certain extent.
The United States could still take advantage of some favorable conditions of the坦本主义 world market at that time to intensify its foreign expansion and more or less alleviate the pressure of domestic overproduction, and the Western European countries were generally in an upward stage, then the present situation is far different.
The situation would be far different now. As the conditions of the crisis in the entire humanist world become more and more serious, the crisis in the United States will certainly become deeper and wider.
The crisis in the U.S. is bound to deepen and expand.

29. 1958

| The United States of America's post-war years.
One can see that in the post-war years, the U.S. broke Chabon's unlimited expansion of production in order to extract the highest possible profits, literally doing everything.
In the post-war years, one can see that the United States has done everything possible to extract the highest possible profits by expanding production indefinitely. But some of the post-war dysentery that played a role in the rise of American production has disappeared and some is disappearing.
Some of these factors have disappeared, some are disappearing, and the artificial stimulus is becoming less and less effective. This is the direct cause of the economic crisis in the United States.
The direct cause of the economic crisis in the United States.

As far back as 1947, when the U.S. imperialist economy was still in the midst of the Yong Sei Qiu Ye, Comrade Mao Zedao said.
In "The Present Situation and Our Task", he predicted that "the economic power of the United States imperialists, which was strengthened during the Second World War, has become destabilized.
The economic power of the United States, which was strengthened by imperialism during the Second World War, has led to an unstable domestic market and a small international market. The further weakening of this market will
The further weakening of the market will lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis. The economic crisis in the United States, which was a "temporary phenomenon", was a complete turnaround of Mao Zedong's economic crisis.
The economic crisis in the U.S.A. completely realized Mao Zedong's prediction.

Although it is not yet possible to make a basic prediction of the depth and duration of the economic crisis in the U.S., according to the present situation, it is generally possible to see that Mao Zedong's economic crisis will be a major factor.
The situation can generally be seen, this crisis will be deep and relatively long-lasting, is not the same as the four and one pill.
It is not comparable to the two crises in the same period of four years and one year ago, when the crisis was shorter and smaller.

In front of the crisis of talent in the United States, there are some people in the United States who hope that the government will take all kinds of "anti-crisis" measures.
Some people in the United States wanted the government to take all kinds of "anti-crisis" measures to stop the crisis, while the monopolists and their politicians. The monopolists and their politicians are also taking their "anti-crisis" measures.
and "anti-crisis" measures.

First of all, the "anti-crisis" measures taken by the American powers-that-be are very generalized. They are trying to create
They tried to create an atmosphere of optimism and to influence people psychologically. Therefore, from Eisenhower to the car king Chet, all of them are changing their minds and trying to make all kinds of tricks.
They are trying to make people not to lose confidence in the U.S. economy.
to lose confidence in the U.S. economy. The bourgeois politicians hail "anti-crisis" measures for one more month, just for the sake of the people. Measures for one more month are aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the people and
to their political opponents. Meanwhile, the Qundo family and their newspapers are working on how to make the crisis healthy and "clear the air".
This is to use the crisis as a means of "cleansing" the material and civil life of the working class and the working people.
A big company "Kroger" attacked the snow chief Hall has played "if you do not have a certain ratio of human resources, the market will not have normal conditions.
If you don't have a certain amount of manpower, there will be no normal conditions in the market. Some newspapers in the United States have also shown that, in order to weaken the threat of capitalism, some increase in unemployment seems to be worthwhile.
Some increase in unemployment seems to be welcome.

In general, there is a great deal of variation within the Hertz group in terms of how the crisis is perceived and what "anti-crisis" measures are being taken.
There are a number of changes within the Hedgehog Group, and they have been going on for a long time. Behind these divisions and theories are the conflicting interests of the various
Behind these arguments are the conflicts of interest between the various political groups and parties of the proletariat. For example, some are in favor of tax cuts, some are against tax cuts, some are in favor of this kind of tax cuts, some
Some advocate tax cuts in this way and some advocate tax cuts in that way.
Some advocate large increases in government spending, while others disagree that this will deepen the deficit and inflation; some advocate the expansion of foreign aid. Some were opposed to the idea of expanding foreign aid". This conflict of interest has caused the governments serving the Barbary Points to be in conflict with each other in the first place.
-This conflict of interest has made the Government which serves the Barbarians indecisive and indecisive on a number of issues.

| The United States has taken a number of steps to counter the crisis.
Some of the "anti-crisis" measures taken by the U.S. government, in a nutshell, are to increase government spending and to loosen the monetary system.
The measures taken by the U.S. government were to increase government spending and to loosen the monetary system. The public works projects that have not yet started (such as roads and hospitals) are not only a drop in the bucket, but will only make a small difference after a considerable period of time.
Only after a considerable period of time will it be able to play a small role. The relaxation of the monetary policy, i.e., the lowering of the credit limit and the relaxation of the terms of the loan amnesty, will be difficult to realize in a crisis situation.
Moreover, the bitter fruit of credit expansion can also cause or accelerate credit and lending crises.

billion dollars. Moreover, military spending is mainly on missiles, which do not require a lot of labor.
Nor can it solve the problem of the serious shortage of labor in enterprises. In fact, this cyclical economic crisis is precisely the result of a military crisis.

If this has not saved the U.S. economy from this economic crisis, how can the military ordering of the U.S. economy overcome the crisis that is already deepening day by day?
How can we overcome the deepening crisis? At the time, due to popular opposition, fiscal deficits and inflationary pressures, the U.S. economy was in the midst of an economic crisis.

It is also difficult for the US government to further increase military spending.
The various "anti-crisis" measures taken by the US government, aa those

The measures taken by the U.S. government to counter the crisis, aa those measures, are only in the "anti-crisis". These measures are only to reduce the productivity, such as to demobilize the workers and to lower the level of medical care of the people, etc. The main purpose is to reduce the productivity of the people.
The main purpose of these measures is to maintain and increase the profitability of the labor force.

Bourgeois scholars and modern revisionists have particularly emphasized the "super-ranking" status of the state and its "regulating" role at the stage of capitalism.
Bourgeois scholars and modern revisionists particularly emphasize the "super-ranking" status of the state in the capitalist stage, its "regulating role", its "economic function" and its "planning capacity". However, as mentioned above, the countries with the monopoly of capital do not have the power to control the advertisement machine, but have no control over the advertisement machine.
But, as mentioned above, the countries with the monopoly of capital not only did not do anything about the machine, but also took some measures to transfer the bad consequences of the crisis to the working people.
In the face of the ever-deepening crisis, how much of a "second-guessing role" and "Yuanji party" can the countries that have cut off capital play? What do you mean by "super-trash"?
What is the nature of the "super-order"? Is it a strengthening of the "planning factor" or a deepening of the state of lawlessness? Here.
Here, too, the modern revisionism of "Rikki" is exposed.

The crisis of the United States of America is the beginning of a worldwide crisis of the net economy of feebenism. This is partly due to the fact that the US is the leader of the imperialist
On the one hand, since the United States is the leader of the imperialist camp and its industrial production accounts for the lion's share of the world's industrial production, the crisis in the United States could not but have a serious blow and a deep impact on the capitalist hunters in the world.
The crisis in the United States could not but deal a severe blow and have a profound effect on the hunters of the capitalist world. On the other hand, because the conditions inherent in the crises in the other countries have changed.
The conditions for a crisis in other countries are already present or are ripe. This makes a worldwide crisis of overproduction unavoidable.
This makes a worldwide crisis of overproduction unavoidable.                          -The crisis of global overproduction has become unavoidable.

In fact, the crisis has already begun in many capitalist countries. The other major capitalist countries, except the United States, have
There has been a generalized phenomenon of overproduction, a decline in the availability of goods, a drop in investment, and a rise in selling difficulties. Shipbuilding and shipping

| The world crisis of the shipbuilding and shipping industries has reached a serious stage.
The world crisis reached a serious level, with more than three million ships in disuse. The crisis also affected the world raw materials market, causing a general decline in the prices of raw materials.
The crisis also affected the world's raw materials market, causing a general decline in the prices of raw materials. Nowadays, the crisis has affected the lives of the people of the most urgent capitalist countries.
The crisis has affected the lives of the people of the capitalist countries. From the very beginning, the US economic crisis has affected the economies of other capitalist countries. The countries most closely linked to the US economy, i.e.
The countries with the closest economic relations with the United States, i.e., the countries with the deepest economic ties with the United States, have been affected by the current crisis in the United States most quickly, directly and obviously.
The countries with the closest economic ties with the United States, i.e., the countries with the deepest ties with the United States, will be affected by the current U.S. economic crisis the fastest, the most directly and the most obviously. Canada, which has extremely close economic relations with the United States, is the first country to follow the United States into a serious crisis.
Japan, which is more dependent on the United States in terms of marriage economy, is also facing a crisis of overproduction. From July last year to this year
From July last year to July this year, Japan's industrial output dropped by 12%. Even according to official figures, the number of workers in Japan's manufacturing industry has fallen from 53 in January of this year.
The number of unemployed workers in Japan has dropped from 530,000 in January to 150,000 in March. The number of unemployed workers in Japan has been
The number of unemployed workers in Japan has always been famous. Due to the lack of sales, Japan's industrial production was still in the process of massive reduction of production. The policy of subsidizing the U.S.A. implemented by the government of Nobuko Yasunosuke was even more important.
The policy of pursuing the U.S.A. greatly deepened the difficulties of Luben's marriage.              5
The situation in Western Europe was also very bad. The industrial output of West Germany had begun to decline. Britain

More or less graded and the United States before the two six ballads Hu crisis. However, now the average speed of industrial production and fixed income in Western countries are declining.
Jiu Ben扳表巴在下降，园时，machinery and equipment and other orders are not enough and industrial production stock is not enough to start also from the day to day significantly.
These phenomena show that the Western European countries are basically the same as the United States, has become a huge scale of fixed capital replacement and expansion.
They are no longer in need of the same kind of fixed capital as they were in the past. They no longer need to import large quantities of production materials from the United States as they did in the past, and they no longer play a role in the crisis in the United States.
They no longer have to import large quantities of material from the United States as in the past, nor do they play a role in the American crisis. On the contrary, they are on the verge of a crisis or have already begun one.

The Central and South American countries, which are basically controlled by the United States, have also been in increasingly serious difficulties under the influence of the current crisis in the United States.
Have been purchased in the increasingly serious difficulties. The hunting economy of these countries is to a large extent dependent on exports, and a large part of their exports are also dependent on exports.
A large part of their exports are dependent on the purchase of the United States (such as Java, fruit, tin, copper, owe, nickel, etc.). Now, as the U.S.
reduced purchases, restrictions on imports, and the imposition of rush sales, these countries have been hit by a reduction in exports and a fall in prices. The United States of America is the only country in the world that has been able to achieve this.
As a result, the situation in these countries is deteriorating and production has declined rapidly.

For other economically backward countries, the development of the current U.S. economic crisis is also having a serious impact.
For other economically backward countries, the development of the current US economic crisis is also having a serious impact. In Southeast Asia, for example, for more than a decade after the second World War, the U.S. controlled about four percent of the export trade of Southeast Asian countries, far more than any other country.
For more than a decade after the Second World War, the U.S. controlled about four-fourths of the export trade of Southeast Asian countries, far exceeding the proportion of other countries. Now, due to the crisis in Southeast Asia, the U.S. has greatly reduced its control over this region.
Now, because of the crisis in China, the United States has greatly reduced its purchase of raw materials (such as rubber, tin, jute, etc.) from these countries, which has resulted in a decrease in their exports and a fall in the prices of raw materials.
As a result, the exports of these countries have been reduced and the prices of raw materials have fallen, which has led to a decline in their production and a decrease in their foreign revenues, and has begun to affect their economic development.

The decline in foreign income began to affect these countries.

|The decline in production in these countries and the fall in foreign income began to affect the employment of these countries.
The employment of these countries was also affected by the decline in their imports and national government. Importation and State Governance.

What is happening now is that the crisis in the United States is contributing to the crisis in other Orange countries, and the crisis in other Orange countries is in turn deepening the crisis in the United States.
The crisis in other countries is in turn deepening the crisis in the United States. In this way, the impact of these shocks will accelerate the development of the crisis in the capitalist world.
The development of the crisis in the world's capitalist countries is thus accelerated by the impact of the crisis in the United States.

With the deepening of the crisis in the United States and the expansion of the crisis to the whole of the Chabonist world, the imperialist countries are fighting to seize the market and the sphere of influence of the United States.
The struggle for the territories and spheres of influence of the imperialist countries is bound to become more intense. The U.S. is trying to spread the effects of the economic crisis to other countries.
The U.S. is trying to spread the effects of the economic crisis to other Chabonist countries and to take advantage of the latter's difficulties to strengthen its control over them. Other countries, on the other hand, have tried to prevent the United States from taking advantage of the crisis.
Other capitalist countries, on the other hand, tried to prevent the influence of the US and resisted the control of the US. One can see that not only the imperialist
It can be seen that not only was the main conflict between imperialism and the United States becoming more and more acute, but also the conflicts between West Germany, France, Japan, the United States and Britain were also becoming more and more impoverished.
The United States, France, Japan and the United Kingdom are also becoming more and more impoverished. The conflict between the United States and West Germany, France, Japan and the United States of America has become more and more acute recently.
The conflict with the U.S. in economic terms has become more acute in recent times. Contrary to the imperialists' arguments about defense and "interdependence", the economic crisis has made them more and more
The crisis has intensified their struggle.

Among the opportunistic countries, in order to counteract the effects of the crisis, the United States colonial policy, and the pursuit of the development of a new socialist system, have been criticized by the international community.
The clamor for the scandal of the search for a unionist state has become even louder. Although some Western political groups are still looking for support for the U.S. colonial strategy and policy.
Although some Western countries are still looking for support for the U.S. colonial strategy and policy, there are forces advocating the improvement of East-West relations and the stabilization of international tensions.
The people of these countries are not the only ones who support the U.S. strategy and policy of seizing power. Not only the people of these countries, but also a growing number of people in the proletariat are realizing the danger of following and relying on the United States.
The danger of adherence and dependence on the United States. Centrifugal and neutralist feelings toward the United States will grow even more.

In the face of the deepening economic crisis, the Jizhouist countries, including the United States, have stepped up their foreign military and economic expansion,
The United States has intensified its foreign military, political and economic expansion, especially the drying up and plundering of colonies, middle colonies and other underdeveloped countries.
The U.S. has been trying to export and move, and to regain its power. As a matter of fact, the pre-colonial world economic crisis started by the United States has already dealt a severe blow to these countries.
The United States has started a pre-crisis in the world economy, which has seriously affected the economic life of these countries. This has led to a growing contradiction between these countries and US imperialism and other shell states.
This has led to a growing contradiction between these countries and US imperialism and other shell states, and to the intensification of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist movements. This situation is particularly
This situation is particularly evident in the recent changes in the situation in Central and South America, which has been the great backyard of the United States. There, the people's anti-American struggle has developed to a great extent.
In order to change this situation and to buy people's confidence, the United States supported and sanctioned the demagogues, who had been put under the thumb.
Nixon, who traveled to South America in order to change the situation and to buy people's hearts, was a full-blown   Nixon was a street rat. With the deepening and widening of the paralyzing economic crisis in the Chabengist world, Asia, Africa, and Central and South America are now in a state of crisis.
With the deepening and widening of the paralyzing economic crisis in the world of Chabonism, the colonialist movements in Asia, Africa and Central and South America are bound to develop further. The imperialist policy of consolidation and expansion is going in the opposite direction.
Imperialist policies of co-operation and expansion are going in the opposite direction, and the process of the colonial masters attacking the system of total domination has been accelerated.

The crisis has also led to a generalized shift within the imperialist countries. Hail Benjamin and his government are using all sorts of
The former working class and other laborers are being attacked by various means, making the latter bear all the consequences of the crisis and become the main perpetrators of the crisis.
As a result, the living conditions of the people worsened. Hunger, food and poverty contributed to the enlightenment of the working class and made them move from Lvmung to

| The evils of the capitalist system were thus strengthened to fight back.
The evils of the capitalist system have strengthened the struggle against them. For example, there have been repeated demonstrations against unemployment in the United States.
Some American proletarian newspapers have also drawn attention to the social and political unrest that can accompany an economic crisis.
The US government has also been criticized by some American newspapers for being aware of the social and political unrest that can occur in a crisis. Of course, in addition to the attacks on the working people during the crisis, there will also be political attacks, more often than not, on the working people.
-In addition to their livelihoods, they will also attack the working people politically, taking away more of their democratic rights and fascizing certain countries. But the pressure is strong.
But the pressure is strong, and the resistance is strong. This worldwide economic crisis, which is based on a widening of the general crisis of capitalism, will not be able to be avoided.
If it continues, it will inevitably contribute to the emergence of political and revolutionary crises in many capitalist countries.

U.S. imperialism is now in the midst of a serious crisis and many contradictions. A long time ago, Comrade Mao Tse-tung said
Comrade Mao Tse-tung's comments on US imperialism's "external strength"? and "the tiger that runs out of steam". have become clearer and clearer with the vivid facts. U.S. imperialism is the most reactionary and devilish
U.S. imperialism is the most reactionary, rotten and dead capitalism, and it has no future at all. It has no future.
It does everything in a very obvious way, just to clean its own grave. Modern Pentecostalism is like the right-wing Congressional Democrats, whose attempts to glorify American imperialism are nothing more than an attempt to make the world a better place.
Their attempts to glorify American imperialism are nothing but a waste of time.

The US imperialists are intensifying their arms buildup and blocking the international tensions in the face of the growing spasmodic economic crisis.
It is also trying to involve other countries in its attempts to find a way out for itself. Therefore, it is necessary for the people to take advantage of this situation.
We must be aware of the possibility of possible provocations and dangers by the SARG. But at the same time, we should also realize that the current international situation is
completely unfavorable to the imperialist strategy and the forces of war. At present, the peaceful forces, with the socialist camp as the main force, have greatly outnumbered the U.S. imperialist forces.
socialist camp as the main force for peace has greatly exceeded the power of the U.S. imperialists as the second force for war. The people of all countries have been trained to put an end to the successes and dangers of chieftaincy.
The risk of human stabilization. If imperialism is suppressed, the people will wipe it off the face of the earth and bring mankind into socialism.
socialism for all mankind.

Contrary to the situation of crises and contradictions in the imperialist countries, the countries of the socialist camps are in a state of euphoria.
The Soviet Union, China and other countries in the unionist camp are in a state of euphoria. The economies of the USSR, China and other imperialist countries were developing at a much faster pace, and there was a great leap forward on all fronts.
The economy of the USSR, China and other unionist countries is developing at a much faster pace, there is a great leap forward in every aspect, and people's life is gradually improving. In Moscow last November, the Soviet Union, led by the Chinese Communist Party, made a concerted effort to improve the living conditions of the people.
After the Moscow Conference in November last year, there was a greater degree of cooperation and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party. Rotary
The contrast between the rise and fall of imperialism and the rise and fall of the world's capitalists has become even more obvious to all the peoples of the world. When the
While the cetacean countries are panicking and at their wits' end before the crisis, the socialist countries are confidently heading for a new
to new heights of feminization. The working people of the socialist countries are realizing more and more that only unionism is the answer to their
the only way out of their disastrous situation.

Let the representatives of the proletariat and revisionists of all colors defend the capitalist system, especially the capitalist tide in the United States!
Go to the defense of the capitalist system, especially the capitalist tide in the United States! Comrade Mao Tse-tung, in his speech at the forty-sixth anniversary of the October Revolution, said, "The socialist system will replace the capitalist system.
It is an objective law that cannot be shifted by people's will that the socialist system will replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that cannot be changed by people's will.
No matter how the reactionaries try to move forward, the revolution will happen sooner or later, and the revolution will inevitably be victorious." Mao Zedong

The working people must be the masters of culture
Ke Qingshi

The working people of the country have been suffering from "poverty and whiteness" for generations. To build our country as soon as possible into a
great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern science and culture is the urgent common aspiration of hundreds of millions of people.
It is the urgent and common aspiration of all the people of China.

At the second meeting of the First Congress of the Communist Party, the Party, on the basis of the experience of the construction of socialism in the past few years and the ideas of Mao Zedong, put forward a set of principles for the life of the Party.
It is of great historical significance that the general line of the Party's construction of socialism was finalized on the basis of the experience of socialist construction in the past years and the ideas of Mao Zedong. Practice
The vegetables make it clear. This line is a correct line. It correctly reflects the theory of Zhu Guan, which is that the productive forces of society
After the great emancipation through socialism, the productive forces of society are bound to herniate rapidly; the hundreds of millions of working people are not only pursuing the socialist system, but are also demanding a change in the socialist system, which is a great significance.
The working people are not only eager to change the "poor and white" situation, but are also eager to change the "poor and white" situation, but are also eager to change the "poor and white" situation. The working people are not only eager to change the "poor and white" situation, but also have endless power to realize their aspirations.
The situation of internal and external struggles at home and abroad also requires us to strengthen the material foundation of Zhu Huism as quickly as possible. If we paralyze this course and go against it, we will be able to realize our aspirations.
If we paralyze this line and violate it, we will be committing a crime. This line of work comes from the masses, the hundreds of millions of working people.
When the wisdom of hundreds of millions of working people is concentrated, it becomes a great material force. The Communist Party and the People's Republic of China
The people see more clearly the direction and road of their own advancement, their thinking is wider, their vigor is higher, and their unity is united.
They are united in their endeavor to win victories. We believe that in ten sob years or shorter time Xiao, in the steel
We believe that within ten years or less, we will catch up with and surpass Britain in the production of steel and other major industrial products! In the field of agricultural production, we will make the production of the main agricultural products and the output per unit area
production and output per unit area of the main agricultural products to match or even exceed the output of a group of subaltern countries is not only a must, but is also entirely achievable.
This is not only necessary, but also entirely achievable.

At the end of the day, can we not take the opportunity to carry out the cultural revolution in the same quick and economical way, in 15 years or more?
In fifteen years or more, the construction of women's culture in our country will run as fast as the construction of the economy, and will gradually reach a very prosperous stage.
What will become of people's spiritual outlook?

We can be so interesting.

By the time we arrive at the car, foreign and middle school education will have been popularized, and every prefecture and county will have set up universities or colleges, and in the majority of villages, there will be a large number of health care centers.
And in the majority of villages, there are schools of higher learning. All the working people of the country "knew the principles of socialism and communism".

The basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, mathematics, astronomy, geology, agriculture, mechanics, chemistry, physics and electronics have all become commonplace.
The general principles of mathematics, astronomy, geology, agriculture, chemistry, physics, and electronics have all become commonplace for ordinary people. The situation of "a hundred ways" for the prosperity of socialist womanization became even more heated. The situation has become even more heated.
The situation will become even more heated, and the progress of science and technology will be rapid. By that time, we will not only have 100,000 or a million specialists in various aspects of science and chemistry, but we will also have a lot of people who will have a lot of knowledge and experience in the field of science.

By the time of Hand, new cultural and artistic activities, WA people (Re) in the rare hunger, not only have a better service to the workers and soldiers, but also the Portuguese language.
Not only did they have Portuguese art that better served the workers and soldiers, but also the workers and peasants were able to create their own art with their own hands more skillfully.
The art of culturalization has been created by the workers and peasants. Every factory, mine and cooperative has its own management center, women's museum, singing team and performing team, all of which have their own origin, importance and vision.
All of them have their own origin, importance, and values. People in both urban and rural areas could not only enjoy movies, but also learn from the TV set.

The new morality, which reflects the foundation of the socialist economy and serves the word, and guarantees further filtration into the communist society, will become the conscious norm of people's thoughts and actions. In the mutual relations of the people and the masses, in the comradeship between the leaders and the masses, in the mutual support of the people and the masses.

The attitudes towards women and women's voices that had been left behind by Tikhon disappeared, men and women became equal, and the country became a big, peaceful family,
The country is becoming a big family of peace and harmony. In the next few years, although the conflict between the individual and the collective will still exist, individualism has become a "common enemy".

The communist society will not be far away from us.

Is it practical for us to practise in this way? My answer is that only our

No. 29.

I'm a little small-minded, and I don't think big enough. In fifteen years or a little more, we will be able to enter other planets.
In fifteen years or a little more, we will be able to enter other planets, there will be a great development of science and feminization, and the people will be able to create more than ever before.
People will create more experience in building faster and more efficiently than ever before, and I have not yet taken into account the changes that will take place.
I have not yet taken this into account. People's thinking is always limited by historical circumstances. Ten years ago, when we were in Yan'an, we were in the midst of a whole new generation of people.
When we were in Yan'an ten years ago, we had all sorts of thoughts about the future, but many of us had no idea that today, five years later, the Party's Congress was going to be held at the same time as the Party's National Congress.
Now, five years later, the Party's Congress of the People's Republic of China is going to discuss in Beijing how to catch up with or even surpass the United Kingdom within the last year or less. Therefore.
Therefore, we believe that although the whole revolution is not without difficulties, the progress of the revolution will be uneven.
Some of the things mentioned above can be accomplished in a year or two, some in five years, and some in more than a decade.
Some of these things can be accomplished in a year or two, some in five years, some in more than ten years, and some in a longer period of time. However, these various sessions are never a resting place.

It is not for no reason that we are so dominant. The most important reason is that our socialist system has opened the way for the women's revolution.
The road to revolution is wide open. In our society, the foundation of the Bamboo Society is getting stronger and stronger every day.
We are urgently called upon to destroy the capitalist culture, which is served by private ownership, and to build a new socialist culture that reflects public ownership and serves it.
We are urgently demanding that we destroy the capitalist culture that serves private ownership and build a new socialist culture that reflects public ownership and serves the public. The continuous development of our socialist productive forces and the continuous improvement of people's livelihoods have also contributed to the development of a new liberalization of socialism before the Sixth Revolution.

 I
Pretty people are laborious, courageous and clever, not only have the great ambition to build a new communist culture, but also have the great ambition to build a new
They not only have the great ambition to build a new communist culture, but also have the endless creativity to build a new communist culture, and they have made indelible contributions to the prosperity of world culture over the past five thousand years.
Is this not an obvious fact? The great leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong is correct, and over the past eight years, we have made great progress in the construction of the new culture.
Over the past eight years, we have made achievements never before seen in the history of our country, and now, under the Party's policy of "quicker, better and more economical", the revolution has reached a high level.
Now, under the Party's encouragement, a high level of women's chemical revolution is being formed, which foretells that we will create a more glorious new Jiaohua, is it not possible that we will create a new Jiaohua?
Is this impossible? Let us see; the policy of thrift work and fat laborers will enable us to make all schoolchildren able to learn in the shortest possible time.
In the shortest possible time, we will be able to enroll all school children in elementary school, all elementary school students in secondary schools (including vocational secondary schools and general secondary schools), and some of them will be able to attend a secondary school.
Some townships have already set up agricultural universities, and workers in Shanghai have already reached the secondary school level by one percent through amateur education.
To the secondary school level, why can't we think that after the 10th period of time, all of us can honor the university students? Our patriotic movement centered on electric shock.
Our patriotic movement centered on electric shock, this year to grasp the sudden market, less than a year, the horse has been a small big effect, why can not say
We want to turn our country into a "four-less country" in a few years. And many infectious diseases are rooted in the four nicknames? In the Great Leap Forward in production, the workers and peasants
The Chinese government has already made so many amazing creations, why can't they think that China will be flooded with a large number of even more commercial bone of the people?
Bun Ban, Li Shida, Daluo and Michurin? Now, the three major industrial and peasant masses are making rapid progress in the movement of socialization, and the masses are also extremely active.
The workers in Shanghai have recently written more than a million works in the district, so why don't we imagine that the art of prize
Why can't we envision the blossoming of the art of prize-winning?

| Why can't we envision the blossoming of prize art?
The problem now is that the climax of the cultural revolution is taking shape, and some of us are still lagging behind in our thinking.
They have not yet fully realized the significance of the cultural revolution for the victory of the socialist revolution and the construction of socialism.
significance. Some of us simply regarded it as a matter of a few chemical work and did not understand that the cultural revolution was always an integral part of the main revolution.
The cultural revolution was an integral part of the revolution and an important part of the construction of socialism, and therefore also the second work of the Party and the people of Deng Xiaoping.
It is also the second career of the Party and the people of Deng. As we all know, the fundamental task of the current ideological and cultural revolution is to further promote proletarianism among the masses of the people of China.
The fundamental task in the current ideology is to further promote proletarianism among the masses of the people of China and to eliminate proletarian thinking. The anti-Rightist struggle has clearly exposed the serious problems in the scientific and cultural battlefield.
The anti-Rightist struggle has clearly exposed serious points in the scientific and cultural war. It is not for nothing that some departments have been described as stinking and dirty "dragon presses" full of proletarianism and carbon monetarism.
The more you do, the more you'll be able to get. Although there have been changes in the past year, the influence of the Kuijian buyer's ideology and the obstructionist ideology is still very serious.
The influence of the Kuijian buyer's ideology and the obstructionist ideology is still serious. We must rapidly push forward the cultural revolution, such as the emergence of a working-class cultural army, before we can fully occupy this position and insert ourselves in the cultural revolution.
We must rapidly push forward the cultural revolution, such as the emergence of a working-class cultural army, before we can fully occupy this position, insert proletarian barbarians and uproot paralyzed proletarian whites. Now, there are still some proletarian scientists, engineers and literary
scientists, engineers and literary artists, although politically there is no longer any table of contents, they still have a party of
They are still holding on to the last "trump card" of the "learned and knowledgeable", and they tax themselves as "oddities", refusing to take a break to build themselves up. It is only when the workers and peasants
It is only when countless experts like Li Gumi, who can cure white ants, are constantly emerging from the peasant masses, that the working people can be swindled.
It is only after the working people's knowledge is much more abundant than theirs, and the working people's knowledge is much more advanced than theirs, that many of them will be able to
It is only after they realize that the knowledge of the working people is much more abundant than theirs, that many of them will become more and more obscene with the skin type, and they will sincerely obey and reform themselves with fear and sickness. Even if there are still a small number of people who are still stubbornly immoral, their fate is much worse than that of those who remained after the Xinhai Revolution.
Even if there are still a handful of hard-core immoralists, their fate will only be even colder and more miserable than that of the old and the young who still have their own offices after the Xinhai Revolution. We should also look at
The spiritual life of the laboring people is also influenced in different ways by the ideological patterns of the creative classes. It is necessary to eliminate
It is only by eliminating the old customs, old habits, old morals and old ways of life left behind by the old sites that we can finally eliminate from people's psyche the markers left behind by the old ideology.
to finally eliminate from people's psyche the specks left behind by the ideology of return. We must enable the masses of workers to lead a new cultural life, both at work and outside of it.
We must make the masses of workers live a new cultural life, both at work and outside of it, and be imbued with the Communist spirit at all times and in all places. Similarly, in the countryside, after the development of production and the improvement of life
Similarly, in the countryside, after the development of production and the improvement of life, the peasants and the masses will not be able to free their minds until there is a change in their social morals and the level of feminization is greatly raised.
We are aware that there are many situations in the countryside. We know that the situation in the countryside is very different from that in the countryside, and that the workers and peasants are helping you to create, avoid, or make progress in the countryside.

The role of the leadership and the interrelationship between the masses. The cultural level of the masses is rapidly rising, and they are able to better manage and monitor the work of the State and help the people.
The time of management and supervision of the work of the state and the work of the state, which forces those who like to choose the official position have to put down the notoriety of the people.
The Government is now in a position to treat the masses as equals. This is also a necessary condition for the development of productive forces.

In this connection, the second meeting of the Party's first congress put forward the tasks of the socialist revolution and the technological revolution at the same time as the Party's socialist agenda.
It is entirely correct, entirely necessary, and timely to put forward the tasks of the revolution of socialization and the technological revolution at the same time as a part of the Party's general road to socialist construction.
It is completely correct, completely necessary, and timely.

Issue 1.31.

The management of the earth's environment

The mission of Feminization Revolution is a calendar scorpion mission that imitates dogs and stings each other. In order to accomplish this task, our society
In order to accomplish this task, our society must let go of the masses and carry out the line of "drumming up energy, waiting for the upstream, quicker, better and more economical", and refuse to pay less and less.
The way. Here we must pay special attention to three problems. The first problem is that, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung has always said, we must adhere to the principle and the spirit of creativity in the same way as the principle and the spirit of creativity.
The first is that, as Comrade Mao Zedong has always said, we should combine principle and creativity, and we should dare to think, to know and to do under the rule of insisting on the principle of lying down. The rationale
But Wangxin must be broken, and if we don't break it, we won't be able to adhere to the truth. We should
We should recognize that there are still a lot of superstitions inside and outside the Party, such as the beliefs of the ancients, the beliefs of the famous scholars of the proletariat, and the beliefs of the society as a whole.
What is left behind is the idea of regimentation, superstition, and the old-fashioned way of doing things, and so on. These beliefs are the things that bind us.
We have to crush them. For example, some people are really afraid of the intellectuals of the proletariat, and they are only interested in the show, not in criticizing and fighting, and so on.
They only criticize and criticize the intellectuals, but they still lack the revolutionary spirit to grasp the truth and to break down and establish. Some of the several editions of the Tan after spinach today, not to be
Selectively a large number of four editions of second-class and "spot four" internal organs of the old works. Of course, the past works of Haumea as a legacy to receive the
Of course, it is possible and desirable to accept many works of the past as heritage.
However, when they published these works, they did not criticize some of the wrong ideas and things, and sometimes even promoted them and helped them to spread bad influence among the masses8 .
On the other hand, for the many works of writing about new activities and new characters, not only did they not vigorously advocate them, but also excessively and inappropriately commented on them.
Instead of vigorously promoting them, they are excessively and inappropriately judgmental. This is leading people to look backward instead of forward. This is by no means a revolution in balletization, but a regression in regionalization.
It is a regression.

The first question is to rely firmly on the masses. Some people regard the cause of socialization as secretive, as if only the specialists are capable of doing it.

They seem to think that only experts can do it and that the masses are powerless. They do not see the great wisdom and power of the masses.

They do not understand that the revolution is a cause for the masses to liberate themselves. It is true that experts are needed in the war room, but, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung has said, "The world's creations and inventions are largely the work of the masses.
But as Comrade Mao Tse-tung has said, most of the creativity and inventions of the world have come from the oppressed classes, from those who have a lower social status, who are less educated, who are less privileged, who have always started out with the best of everything.
The most inventions are made by the oppressed classes, by those who are of lower social status, less educated, less qualified, and who are always looked down upon at the beginning, and who are beaten, tortured, and tortured. There are many experts
It was later on that they remembered that they had learned half of what they had learned. In order to carry out the revolution, it is not possible to do it only with the experts of the Party but not with the masses.

The third issue is that we must oppose the mentality of self-satisfaction and backwardness. New Yong and other new things like, just out of more
When the new Yong and other new things like, just out of more, always incomplete, always in the Bureau of things in the bucket of thousands of growth and development. Some people do not understand
Some people don't know this law, they always think that we can't do this or that, this is also young, that is also childish, they only have the eyes of the ancients and the foreigners.
In their eyes, there are only the ancients and the foreigners, and they are net self-centered, holding on to the past and not advancing, or only advancing to the group, not respecting the leap forward. This kind of backward attitude is obviously a copy of the homogenized revolution.
Obviously, this kind of backward attitude is not in line with the great task of the revolution.

The working people should be the masters of nature and the masters of culture.
They should also be the masters of culture. Comrade Mao Zemmerg told us long ago that with the economic construction, a climax of cultural construction would inevitably emerge.

Now the time has come. We must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong Zhouzhi, break down superstitions, and oppose self-cultivation.

We must follow the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and Mao Zedong's Zhou Zhi, break down superstitions, oppose backwardness, further emancipate the minds of all our comrades, and, together with the masses of the working people, raise the momentum of the cultural revolution.
We will further emancipate our minds, work together with the masses of the working people, and accomplish the tasks of the Sixth Nationalization Plan.

| The year of 1958.
The masses are the force behind it.
  Wang Renzhong

In order to carry out the construction of unionism, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, and to conduct a large-scale mass movement with a lot of sound and color.
What I am trying to show in this article is that the mass movement in Hubei Province has led to the agricultural production movement on a large scale.
The following is an example of a mass movement for agricultural production in Hubei province.            "
After the advent of agricultural cooperativization, Hubei Province has made great achievements in agricultural production. Since last winter, on the basis of the civic un
climax, a new high zai of great leap forward in agricultural production has been measured. The masses of Hongmin people responded warmly with practical actions to the
The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Bleu Tung's great guidance of drumming up energy, striving to make progress, and building socialism more quickly and with better economy.
Their socialist enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and they were heroic in the production of goods in a way that no one had ever been before.
With their unprecedented heroism in the field of production, they created the miracle of "one day is more than twenty years".

The objective situation calls for us to further improve our methods of guidance, so that we will not be able to make a deal with them, but will be able to make a deal with them in the future.

Instead, we should be able to stand in front of the masses and push the movement forward.

Mao Zedong, in his 1913 speech on "Some Questions on the Methods of Guidance", urged us to strive to learn the scientific methods of guidance.
We should endeavor to learn the scientific methods of guidance of Marxism and to overcome the subjective and bureaucratic methods of guidance. Comrade Mao Zedong has deeply emphasized the importance of
Comrade Mao Zedong has clearly understood the two basic methods of integrating the general and the individual, and of integrating the valuation guide and the masses, and has reiterated. "In all the practical work of the Party, wherever the right thing is done, the right thing is done, the right thing is done.
"In all practical work of the Party, all proper guidance must come from the masses and go to the masses." (And "The Selected Works of Zedong? The Third Pavilion).
According to our practical experience in the past two years, I have come to realize deeply that we must learn quietly the method of guidance pointed out by Mao Zedong, and put it into practice.
I have come to realize that it is necessary to learn the methods of guidance pointed out by Mao Zedong and to apply them properly to the work of the Party in order to bring the agricultural production movement into good harmony with guidance.

In our agricultural production campaign in Hubei Province, we have mainly adopted the following methods: Lead cadres take the lead in the work, especially in the field-testing campaigns.
In particular, we take the lead to test the fields, set up a distinctive family sail through on-site meetings, lead the way with points, lead the backward with the advanced, and start a great socialist competition to mobilize the big bribery movement.
The socialist contest, mobilize the big bribery, big release, big debate, write big Yu newspaper, regular inspection and envy, according to the production season memory, grasp the good production in all aspects.
Grasp good production in each link, as far as possible to protect early to do the next - step of the banana preparation work, and ruthlessly grasp the production of this center work, bring the village work at the same time.
We are practicing "from the masses, to the masses" through these specific methods, bringing the work of the villages forward at the same time.
It is through these concrete methods that we implement the original formula of "from the masses, to the masses", "general and individual combined", and "town leaders and the masses combined".

(a) The first step in the way of the masses is for the Ministry to take the lead.

In most of our counties, districts, towns and villages, the poor guide departments, which have been liberated from a series of steep grades, have been dissected and formed a large and small group in the local community.
In the local area, they have formed a large and small group of people. His exemplary actions have been a great impetus to the progress of the masses.
At the same time, the supervision and criticism of the masses, for their progress, also has a great role in promoting.

Whether to take action and lead the masses or to stand on their heads and criticize them is a question of whether to do it personally or to stand on the heads of the masses.

The first issue is e39.

| The first is that the people of the country are the ones who have to pay the price of the goods and services.

He looked at him and put his head aside. He was discouraged and determined to take concrete action to change the community's perception of him. At that time, the weather was flashing.
When the weather was hot, he went into the water to pick up some mud, and when the water tanker was running, people did not realize that he was going into the mud, but he put his socks on his wrist and jumped to the bottom of the water tank.
The members of the community was surprised to see him work very vigorously, so, more than forty members of the community jumped into the mud to do it. To the end of the work
At the end of the day, the attitude of the members towards Quan changed completely, this one joined him for dinner, that one invited him to drink water. Since then, he has been leading the way.
Since then, his leadership has not only changed the members' attitude towards him, but also the cooperation of all the members is waiting for him to go to the village. Half of them are from one community.

The year after the incident, the two sets of Xingfa, whether it is closed to the good, or with two good, a few school children have been the Ministry in the middle of doing to get a number of vice. The supervision and criticism of the masses, for
Phoenix Xuegui's progress, played a driving role.
Many cadres have the same experience as Xuegui. After the rectification, the leadership has become a must among all the cadres of the Beacon Guides.
It has become a must among all the cadres. Many peasants said that our good cadres were "good disciples brought up by Mr. Mao". The relationship between the Ministry and the masses became closer.
The relationship between the cadres and the masses has become even closer. Cadres and the masses pushed each other, energized each other, and a culture of striving for excellence naturally took shape.
(a) One of the best and most common ways for the guiding cadres to take the lead is to engage in inert driving.
Since and the provincial party committee general sticking to the Thi An county shi guiding cadres to pick two test gongs of the multi-stage put, especially since the central government issued a report about the
After the central government issued a circular on the subject of all kinds of superior cadres to engage in experimental work, the cadres engaged in rural work in the province have been trying out the cellular defense. Cadres of the relevant
Cadres of the village work departments also planted test plots, and planting test plots became the center of the thoughts and actions of many Yu Ministries. Out

Running, set the night up grams of rain, but also mold Ji test bed field with a flashlight brief illumination. Some comrades simply became fans of the test field.
The quality of the cadres, technicians and farmers, the three together, is the main form of seed test and Yang. The advantage of this "triple bonding" is that it makes these three people take advantage of each other.
The advantage of this "three bonding" is that these three people complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, feel each other's bottom line, and sympathize with each other.
The three of them are better than each other. For the cadres of the organization, it is very beneficial to try each one of them. If you know the answer to the question, you will know all about the Kuhuai.
After planting one more test skin, the two guides will have to deal with technicians and farmers in every production process.

people, he can understand what kind of ideas the technicians and farmers have in each part of the nonproduction process and how to deal with these ideas.
The first secretary of Cheng Peng's Wuha field. When Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the Culan County Party Committee, was sowing wheat in his Wuha field, Cheng advocated strip sowing, but Hongmin Laotai advocated spot sowing.
The technicians advocated "resolute strip sowing" regardless of whether the old Luok passes or not. The sticky fruits of Kotian, in the three fields of the Zhi test, did two things.
The two of them are in the same field. Cheng Gum did strip sowing, and Lao Qin did spot sowing. The same deep plowing, fertilization, the same
The same deep plowing, fertilizer, the same seed, strip seeding of the seedling dense, point sowing of wheat seedlings sparse, and now the old vegetarian convinced to lose. After the strip seeding dense planting and point sowing planting of the pair
This is the stage, all the people who advocate spot seeding are convinced. This kind of nine honors to sing the opposite drama of the method, is the Yue II antithesis of the method, is Shan do not serve, wait for the

The ten kinds of guided test outside the theater of the genus gas, quickly developed into a new into the meeting of the ten gas. Nowadays, the masses also exist to engage in altar road
Now, the masses are also engaged in altar road qu, not only the small present total plus field, but also have a large area of abundant production on Taipo, which is a new change of the test of Yuntian.
This is a new development of the trial field. This new development has created a very promising situation for the balanced production of agriculture and for the technological innovation of the masses.

This new development created extremely favorable conditions for the movement of balanced production and technological innovation in agricultural production. For example, of the more than three million people in the Huangyue area, more than 600,000 farmers have planted the filtered rice fields. Kuangshui County was founded by

Lv Yuanming's test field created a new record of rice yield of 1,600 kilograms, which attracted many peasants to
Engage in wu test field. An old farmer, who called himself "Mr. Jin", in Tianmen, a small wind-attacking village in Tianmen County, had his fields mixed with rice. He was a farmer, who had been mixing the rice with the rice, and had made a test field, which was called "Weipi".

The to start, to his, to do, the hall is sex empty words but in the base work, practical work. This kind of communist spirit of the old man.
This kind of communist spirit is very valuable. This old man's spirit of communism was manifested in a situation where the communist spirit of the masses was growing.
The old man's spirit of communism was manifested in a situation in which the communist spirit of the masses was growing stronger and stronger.

The growth and development of the experimental fields in the whole country and in the provinces is still unbalanced. There are some people who still flash jokes there. A regimental secretary in Jingzhan County.

Peasants are down on the two main and three experimental fields.  Some other cadres have been dividing the year between the donkey fields and the poems. We've got to get the equipment, the fertilizer and the seeds.
fertilizers and seeds. Some of the fields had high yield targets, but the measures to increase production were disproportionate, and some of the fields were poorly planted.

Farmers called them "Chau Hou Tin", "Wu Han Tin", "Promoting Retreat Tin*. Until now, there are still some people who are still in the process of "planting training and experimental fields and ideological work".
Some people said, "The seed training and the ideological work don't go well together." There were people who thought, "Planting a field is a kind of extra-municipal burden." Obviously, these people had not yet been able to realize that the Kaishinto had been a part of the Party.

It is clear that these people have not yet realized the essence of the Central Committee's instructions on the planting of rice fields. For this group of people, it is necessary to carry out more ideological battles, and at the same time, it is also necessary to

At the same time, they should also be given concrete help by the villages.                                     -They must be given specific help in their villages.
It is essential to turn the planting of rice fields into a system to be observed by every rural cadre, and all cadres should follow this system.
Each cadre should follow the path of integration of guidance and the masses, political parties and technology, and specialization in bamboo. Recently, the province has conducted an agricultural ugly production program.

This is a great promotion for the cultivation of agricultural land. Now, the Party in many places has taken measures to strengthen the trial-planting program.

Chatian work measures. For example, in the Yellow Hernia area, the Party has adopted a card system for the test fields, which is carried out by sub-committees, and the second part of the test fields is covered by labor and production, with the help of leading cadres, technicians and farmers.
In the area of Huangxia, for example, a system of cards for field-testing was adopted in which the sub-committee was responsible for the field-testing, and the second part of the field-testing was organized on a labor- and production-contracting basis.
The purpose of the system was to consolidate and expand the achievements of the donkey fields, including the introduction of standardized technical measures and regular inspections and evaluations.

Tenth issue, 2

In order to popularize the advanced departments, it is necessary to convene the opening ceremony, and only then to compare and contrast the results of the four phases, in order to bring the whole area to the advanced departments.
In order to promote the advanced ministries, it is necessary to hold an opening ceremony, and then generalize the situation.

However, there are many places that still do this. In these places, there are focuses, there are ethnic groups, there are groups that have advanced by type; there are groups that have advanced by type.
However, they treat the advanced model as a shower, which is only appreciated by a few people in the yarn, and they keep it at home, but do not hold it high.
And they don't hold it up high. When they see it raised elsewhere, they think to themselves: "We have this flag too!
We also have a flag ......". What's the use of having a flag that's just for the family, but not for the home?" Just to have an advanced model, but not to promote an advanced test bed, is not a good idea.
What's the point of having a typical model if you don't promote it? In 1957, the story of Macheng County and Xinji and each other's points of comparison.
The story of the comparison between Macheng County and Xinjian in 1957 illustrates this point. The yield of cotton per unit area in Xinzhou is higher than that of Yecheng County. The two provinces are famous
The cotton production townships of Liu Ji Township and Dafu District are the key townships of Xinzhou County. Ma Yan County is determined to catch up with Xinzhou County, many times.

Under the general policy and line of building socialism more quickly and economically, the socialist party in the two provinces has been working hard and striving to build socialism more quickly and economically.
The socialist party race in the province had already formed into a large-scale mass movement. At a meeting of branch secretaries held by the Xiangyang local committee.
At the meeting of branch secretaries held by the Xiangyang local committee, the secretary of Talking Yin County Committee, Mr. Zheng Yin's speech contained the words "Gai Suixian", which were found by Mr. Wei Ji of Suixian County Committee. Suixian County Committee

(none) In the contest of membership, people created rich and colorful ways to carry out the fight between the first and the second.
The most important ways were the Great Debate, the Great Tasting, and the Great Inspection.

It is a great way to make a big newspaper, to make a vivid and vivid order to live in the water, and to make the words that have been used in the words by the people and the letter.
It is a new form of unionist democracy that has been utilized in some people's words.

The topic of "debate" is very focused and specific; the participants in the debate are very broad and the form of debate is very flexible.
The form of the defense is very flexible; the field and the ground, the dry medical walk, the bedside stove, inside and outside the meeting, all can be identified; father and son,
Husband and wife, offense and woman, Bo nuisance ...... or not, all can become the right bamboo to pretend to answer. Many of the ten yes petal koi, due to personal deep
The cut head sword, into a touch that is rose. After a question and discussion, right and wrong are clear. In such a case, the work is good to do.
Backward conservative thinking is relatively easy to overcome, on the advanced hydrocarbon pass good promotion.

One of the more notable forms of class healing is the Daewoo Newspaper. It started last winter, and only in the spring of this year it has been
The village of the disaster has arisen to seek. Kaiye, cadres are very tiki university newspaper, now Haumea more cadres are not afraid of, they party to the sweetness of the large-print newspaper people
The The big-character newspaper is often in the work of the most critical time, the cone will guide on the help of a big sex; often in the cadres of the numbness and complacency, fast and more swing with the read on time.
It is often a blow to the head when the cadres are complacent and quick to follow. For those cadres who usually do not accept the public's opinions, once they have the opportunity, they will be centrally posted on the website.
They will focus on posting big-character posters, which are very effective and quick in harvesting. "


One of the big newspaper brush: "Li Zhiguo, do not work, the night meeting always send their own, stacked up - an end of the double one to, the next
The test sitting night is still in the house. Some members of the temple to play Hal, some members of the community to mention, he descended from the reunification of the meeting did not go on the history, he is still there
He is still there, knocking down. ......? In a short period of time, the words paint a picture of "official Daiism". The words were a picture of the face of "official Daiism". Another large-print newspaper spun: "Called Xiaoyun.
He's sovereign, he's got a face, his eyes are rolled back, he's a good man. Look at his diarrhea, and the elephant in the room, a ditch a ditch a ditch.
He is the only one who has ever made a mess of the field, and he is the only one who has ever made a mess of the seedling. ......? A short sentence, live painting an image of the impersonation of insiders.
According to the pleasant, only after the criticism of the next day, there will be a change in the work.

A big-character poster like this is not necessarily posted only when a rectification campaign is launched. Whenever you want to post it, you can do so.
No matter whether it's praise, criticism, or a visit to ......, it can all go on the Daewoo Newspaper.

As long as it is on the big word newspaper things, there must be closed fall, because, big word newspaper once posted, will become the resident of the meeting of the
Something. Under the strict supervision of the masses, it is not allowed that any one thing has not if fall. Recently, in the spring plowing
production, there has been a new development. This is what the peasants call the "Husband and Wife Tianchi Newspaper" and the "Foot and Sister Large Character Newspaper":.......
Husband and wife, brother and sister, father and son of the out, and well not for family matters and Zhu Hua, but for national affairs, for the director of the study of flowers, chi koi get not

The teacher's meaning of this "you report I write*" is "to put her army", its negative she reported not gills to come. Lift Dezhou angry to the end of the name: "Well, I wide you write: 'captain this outside when, good big!
The official air ......" The teacher did not have too much, when the two sentences. She said, "I'll report it, you write it." The teacher had no choice but to write. The teacher had to write.
After writing it, Frog Dezhou picked it up and walked away, and when he saw Godou, he huffed and puffed and put the large-character poster in a discreet manner, "You owe me to take it and put it up, and you have to put it up at the intersection of your house and on your door.

They were unanimous in criticizing Starfish and supporting the study of Germany. Frog Dehai epidemic have to live, and finally posted a large-character poster, admitting that his "crop gas is very heavy", said "resolutely accept".
So the siblings made up well.

Like the posters of the fathers and sons of the families, the relationship between the people of Maroho began to evolve from a family relationship to a new relationship of complementarianism.
to a new kind of socialist relationship. The common purpose of people is to be advanced, to catch up with the advanced, to learn from the advanced.
In a word, for the sake of progress. For this reason, we have made the large-print newspaper into a promotion newspaper.

In the midst of the fire inspection, there are more such promotion papers. The big inspection is the big promotion. And the provincial party committee decided to use the provincial party committee
The provincial party committee decided to use the provincial party committee to carry out a big inspection in Xuzhou province, one or two times a year, and there were big inspections by the local party committee and the county party committee to the district and the whole county four times a year. Every kan inspection
The timing of the inspection, and are in the two production office craftsman to bear the next time. Before the inspection, Xibeishan notified, once each place received the big inspection, they started to inspect the whole county from the beginning to the end.
When they received the notice of the inspection, they were nervous from the bottom to the top. Some people said, "This kind of notice is a big mobilization. That's true.
This is true. The work in many areas has improved by leaps and bounds before the inspection.

The inspection booklet of the Committee and the Committee for the Inspection of the Work of the People's Republic of China was attended by the responsible departments of all Hu Party committees, agricultural technicians, staff of various departments, and exemplary models of Hongye Zhidong.
Staff, Hongye Zhidong model and other people to participate. Everywhere we went, we learned about the situation, solved the problems, and handed over the information to the people.
Visiting spasms, "Walking on flowers" and "Dismounting to see flowers". and "dismounting to see the flowers?" The combination of The mass dolphin checking is "promotion pump" and "condolence group". It's a "sympathy tour".
The people who participated in the thick inspection books, while looking at the flowers, were "taking a drive", and the inspection tours were "study tours". Some cadres, who seldom traveled to the countryside in the past, participated in the study tours.
Some cadres who seldom went to the countryside in the past, after taking part in this kind of inspection, said that they had been misguided and misguided. Many miracles have been created by the vast number of people in the remote Canggu County.

It is the fact that the new "Bamboo Parking" has been used to govern the new downward mobility of people in the countryside. Province County

The current home production is - a promotion of the work of the ministries and stations is - a type of regional movement, for the six big pregnant | the
The fire cocoon bamboo. The masses recalled their strong feelings of welcome to the thrift field, bud hernia inspection of the Si pull out a lot of construction visits and Jie request. Look at the
The request, this day of inspection of the party activities, but also a very good form of contact with the masses.

The province's big spring checkup has been carried out in the middle of March, and a big checkup will be held in the middle of July.
Inspection. By the end of the year, and then call and smoke the provincial agricultural party into the workers will be plaque, for the province's agricultural production, nearly a happy general essence and evaluation.

In the mass inspection and comparison, advanced things Îþi and backward things, and all with extremely vivid image storm in front of the masses, forming a very strong and sharp contrast, so that the majority of the masses

A new situation has arisen. All walks of life were leaping forward, all had the requirements of time and task, and all had the guidance of the mouth. Many tasks
The cooperative is being pressurized with many tasks at the same time. Some of them were not properly organized, so they had to spread their energies and relax their production.
The Provincial Party Committee Inspection Group took resolute measures on this weekly issue. It was not to let all the ministries to be free to drink cold water, but it was to make all the ministries stand under the guidance of the Party Committee.
However, it asked all the departments to deploy their forces under the guidance of the Party Committee, and asked the departments to plan for a leap forward within the production-centered comprehensive leap forward plan formulated by the Party Committee.
The front door of each department should submit all slogans to the Party Committee for review. In short.
In the current situation of agricultural production, the Party Committee should firmly grasp the central work of production and make the macro-industry take the lead.
The Party Committee should firmly grasp the production as the center of work and make the macro-industry take the lead in promoting the pseudo-beneficial work, and the departments should work well under the premise of serving the production first.
The work of each department should be done under the responsibility of the headquarters network before serving the production in the first place. This requires the Party Committee to realize centralized and remote guidance under the principles of collective guidance and division of responsibilities. This
This is a working policy and a method of guidance. Only by strengthening the Party Committee's guidance can we correctly solve the problems of centralized work and departmental and stationary work.
correctly resolve the relationship between the central work and the work of the ministries and stations, in order to ensure the realization of the Great Leap Forward in production and the Great Leap Forward in the work of the holy surface.
The realization of the great leap forward in production and the great leap forward in the work of the holy surface. This method of seizing the central work to drive the public work is one that the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always emphasized.
We should adhere to this method in our future work.

In the "CE" inspection, a very good method was realized, that is, according to the production seasons, we should grasp every production season and the wells and the workplaces.
That is, according to the production seasons, we should grasp each production season and try our best to make good preparations for the next season or the next year.

Take wheat production for example. In many places, the various aspects of wheat production are tightly grasped, from sowing all the way to the big sale.
Sowing all the way to the wolf food sale, not a step to relax; . And the situation in previous years out up, this year around the special attention to the small test
The latter part of the work of answering The Xiangyang Specialized Public Security Department's one-regulation small-sale test field was swabbed as "three" during the Spring Festival visit and compared to the other.
The masses of the public security office were cried out in big-character posters. The comrades of the Public Security Office were not discouraged, and actively replenished the seedlings, chased fertilizer, and fresh water.
In one month, the three types of seedlings became one type. We went to the test men to see, unanimously agreed that the need for this sound test field.
son, there is a big mu yield of a thousand kilograms of possible. Contrary to this situation, if there is a ring of defense did not grasp, if the front is tight and then loose, a class of the past may also turn into a class of the past.
A class of the past may also become three types of back. From this, I can get such a reed, in the crop is not in the hands of the time, we do not to easy to declare victory.
When the crop is not yet in hand, we should not declare victory easily, nor should we take defeat easily. Even if the second grows well, we should make it even better.
Even if the crop grows poorly, we should make it good from bad to worse, and we should do whatever we can according to the situation of the crop growth.
If you can do it, you must insist on doing it to the end. If there is a natural disaster, we must fight against the natural disaster until the end. Until the crops are in hand, the victory will be declared.
or no harvest has been finalized, then you can admit your failure. We should not declare victory too soon.
prematurely declaring victory and prematurely accepting defeat are both manifestations of the rising qi. The "three types of Gan? The small talents of the
can be transformed into a small person who can transfer a thousand pounds of production, which is due to the fact that there is no discouragement of the Mu reason. Our approach is based on each crop

和甸节,都融不上对 于发 引产的具体候导。
The specific guidance for agricultural production is also expressed in the preparation of the next stage of production. In order to make all the show parties
In order to enable all parties to make preparations for next year's agricultural production, the Party Committee convened a meeting of all local committees and county committees in Gucheng County in early May.
The committee's first on-site meeting was held in Gucheng County to discuss the general branding and summer harvest and to arrange for fall planting. A few years of helping to feel the days, for agricultural production.
The first issue 45.

Not only to grasp tightly, grasp hard, but also to describe the maple grasp drought. This year's great leap forward in production came very violently, making us deeply
This year's great leap forward in production came very violently, making us feel deeply that we are not well-prepared both in terms of thinking and material. In order to make a bigger leap forward next year, we held a meeting before the summer harvest.
Before the summer harvest, we held meetings and visits on autumn planting, followed by meetings and visits on water conservancy and transportation, and planned and arranged for all the work related to winter protection and spring protection.
Early arrangements, so that the production of all things paralyzed, so that the cadres and masses have the ideological preparation, so that after this year's autumn teeth, we may have sufficient bananas, so that they can be used in a variety of ways.
In this way, after the fall of this year, we can have sufficient banana preparation, let go of mobilizing the masses, revitalizing -~ a larger-scale winter annual production climax.

The CPC Central Committee and Mao Zedong have always advised us, "Never fight an unprepared battle". Early preparations will help us to
and to put the Party in a position to take the initiative.

Agricultural Tools and Technological Revolution

A few ways to reform the agricultural tools in Yunnan Province.
Zheng Gang
Comrade Mao Zedong puts the furniture collects Liang's mass movement, :a after ten thousand zu, also exceeds the past tow millennium's sum.

See it as the germ of the technological revolution. This murmur, in going

South Province horse gangs show its correctness and significant far-reaching "-

significance. The Yunnan bamboo, like the Principality, is extensively
a mass movement for the conversion of farm implements into boats. This
movement is forced by the requirements of the great leap forward in agricultural production.
Its development, in turn, pushed Han
It has in turn pushed forward and promoted the industrial asthma
The movement has changed the way people use their medicines.

In order to "fight for three years and change the face of the countryside? The cloud

Yunnan Province carried out a large-scale farmland infrastructure construction in the spring.
The province has carried out a large-scale farmland infrastructure construction program. By the end of April, the water conservancy construction was completed with twelve million cubic meters of water.
million south (each zhuoshan water 400 cubic meters), equal to after liberation
and years of the total amount of construction of two sales, pre-liberation children's millennium curse of adultery
The total amount of three Fu. Yunnan Province is located in the plateau, the Han is a high

Fangnan to even a hundred thousand acres of water to build Xi, wing height of 30 meters to 50 meters of the project.
meters to 50 meters high, there are many projects, the task is more difficult.
The task is quite difficult. The accumulation of fertilizer Yu April stop, the main average of each training demolition of left fertilizer has been
The big one hundred and twenty quintals. The change of terraced land and the change of the county's upper border were nearly two hundred and twenty tons.
46.

 Xiao Mang and the newly liberated mom in Chiliu Da Nation Autonomous County, the region, are the only ones to have been liberated.

The increase in paddy land this spring amounted to seven cents per acre.
From the more proto-colonial society of direct valley integrationism filtered through the
In Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, in the high Lizi Mountains, which range from 4,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level.
In the mountains of Gao Li Zi at an altitude of 4,000 meters to 4,000 meters above sea level, the terraced fields have been opened in seven equal parts.
However, before the construction of the agricultural infrastructure was completed, the battle against drought and seeding had already begun.
The battle against drought and seeding has begun again. Since the last quarter of last year, Yunnan Province has been in a prolonged drought without rain.
Since the last quarter of last year, Yunnan Province has been in drought for a long time without rain, and the amount of rose water is very large.
Vegetable water has begun to post crazy, the public province farmers are following the stove hair control

The farmers in the province are now battling with the battles, fighting with the time, running with the time guards, and making thousands of ways to get the water to the farmers.

The farmers in the province are fighting with the time to sow seeds, and are determined to get a good harvest this year.
To accomplish the above tasks, the small power needed is more than
previous years. The labor enthusiasm of the masses is
The labor enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedented, and the labor rate reached more than nine percent.
Even on the spring festival, they did not take any vacation, and their daily working hours increased by
The number of labor hours per day has increased by one shekel compared to the previous years. It is precisely after the flow of tools in Yunnan rural areas that the mushroom many
In addition to a machete and a head, there are no other tools.
There are other tools, Yu and Niu Kaiming, did not make full use of.
In the construction sites and field transportation inspection, the main vibration people fishing, household picking, head

The top of the hill is the top of the hill. This kind of mushroom phenomenon exists; if we only rely on feeding the labor intensity and improving the labor group, we cannot solve the problem.
The problem cannot be solved simply by feeding the labor intensity and improving the labor group.
The problem cannot be solved by feeding the labor intensity and improving the labor team alone. In this way, in the march to nature, the problem of labor shortage and labor shortage is not solved.
The Great Leap Forward in production and the shortage of labor force and low labor productivity are the same.
In this way, in the march to nature, the problem of labor shortage and low labor productivity, which is the cause of the Great Leap Forward, is becoming more and more acute.
They have to use their brains, change their tools, and work hard to get out of the natural state of affairs.
They are trying hard to get out of the natural state of labor.

The movement to improve the tools started from the water conservancy site, and was followed by the movement to improve the tools.
and immediately spread to field transportation and other aspects of agricultural production.
It was immediately followed by field transportation and other aspects of agricultural production. At present, nearly 3,000 kinds of agricultural tools have been improved and more than 2 million of them have been popularized in the province.
At present, nearly 3,000 kinds of agricultural tools have been improved in the province and more than 2 million pieces have been popularized. Because of the use of Feng Feng transport alarm on
medicine labor in Yunnan Hongye production center has been four to seventy percent.
The number of improved tools accounts for 70% of the total number of improved agricultural tools in Yunnan.
One-third of the improved farming tools of the former horse. "Eliminate the abbot man wording,
The "elimination of the man, the man picks, the head", "to realize the cart, oxen and horse carts,
"to realize carting, ox-carting, and this way", became the goal of the farmers in the province.
This has become the goal of the peasants in the province. At present, more than 1,400 communes in 20 districts have realized this goal.
This goal has now been realized in more than 1,400 communes in 20 districts. Xuanliang alone, a small county with a population of more than 100,000 people
In Seonryang alone, a small county with a population of over 100,000, various kinds of railroad tracks have been sold in Jeonwon,
In Seonryang alone, a small prefecture with a population of over 100,000, more than 200 kilometers of railroads (railroads and railroads) have been constructed.
and 4,000 vehicles of various kinds were promoted. It is expected that most of the districts in Hitachi Province will be closed by the end of May.
In May, most of the districts in the province will be automobilized, and in Pyonggi
The province is expected to realize vehicleization in most districts in Quangchenbun and the transformation of Binh Jieh district into a railway.

The result of improved tools has greatly improved labor efficiency.
The result of improved tools has greatly improved labor efficiency. For example, the use of an oxcart is five times more efficient than the use of a man's cart; the use of a wooden cart is fifteen times more efficient.
five sheds; using wooden plus C carts, the efficiency is increased fifteen times.
The use of a wooden barrow with a layer of iron on it improves the efficiency by more than ten times.
The use of the Bureau of pulling trains on the Jishou, can be improved four \ Wang ten times.
The improvement of each tool has further encouraged the group to be more productive and motivated.
and enthusiasm of the group, and promoted the measures to increase production.
The implementation of these measures forced people to further improve their tools.
The implementation of these measures forced people to further improve their tools. With the development of the reform movement in the agricultural counties, the

and finally increased to fifteen million mu8 , and the implementation of the plan has also increased from four thousand pounds per Xuanjian to one thousand pounds per Xuanjian.
The program has also increased from 4,000 mou per Xuanjian to 1,000 mou, and now the real
The factory has reached twelve thousand pounds. Historically, the Dai area was not fertilized.
Fertilizer in the Dai area, this year, the amount of fertilizer electricity to reach 10,000 pounds per mu.
10,000 pounds, and is still increasing. Cadres and the masses
The cadres and the masses are promoting each other's efforts, and the reform of agricultural tools, production
and measures to promote each other, and the improvement of labor efficiency and

The Great Leap Forward has become a prominent feature of agricultural production.

The facts show that, without the progress made in the past year, there would not have been any significant increase in the number of farmers who have been able to make the leap in agriculture.
Without last year's victory in political and ideological warfare and the consequent emancipation of the mind, there would have been no significant improvement in the agricultural production of the country.
